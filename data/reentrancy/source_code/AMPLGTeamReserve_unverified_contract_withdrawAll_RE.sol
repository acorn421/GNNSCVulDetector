 * ===== SmartInject Injection Details =====
 * Function      : withdrawAll
 * Vulnerability : Reentrancy
 * Status        : Not Detected
 * Type          : Function Modification
 *
 * === Verification Results ===
 * Detected      : False
 * Relevant      : 0 findings
 * Total Found   : 7 issues
 * Retry Count   : 0
 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a stateful, multi-transaction reentrancy vulnerability by:
 * 
 * 1. **Added State Variables** (assumes these exist in contract):
 *    - `mapping(address => uint256) public pendingWithdrawals` - tracks pending withdrawal amounts
 *    - `uint256 public totalPendingWithdrawals` - tracks total pending withdrawals
 * 
 * 2. **Created Vulnerable State Management**:
 *    - Stage 1: Sets pending withdrawal state BEFORE external call
 *    - Stage 2: External call (transfer) that can trigger reentrancy
 *    - Stage 3: State cleanup AFTER external call (creates vulnerable window)
 * 
 * 3. **Multi-Transaction Exploitation Pattern**:
 *    - **Transaction 1**: Legitimate withdrawal call sets pendingWithdrawals[owner] = balance
 *    - **Transaction 2**: During the transfer callback, attacker can exploit inconsistent state
 *    - The vulnerability exists because state is updated after the external call, violating CEI pattern
 * 
 * 4. **Stateful Nature**:
 *    - The vulnerability relies on persistent state (pendingWithdrawals mapping)
 *    - State changes accumulate between transactions
 *    - Multiple function calls can exploit the inconsistent state window
 * 
 * 5. **Realistic Vulnerability**: 
 *    - Based on real-world patterns of staged withdrawal systems
 *    - Common in contracts that implement withdrawal limits or approval mechanisms
 *    - The state tracking appears legitimate but creates a reentrancy window
 * 
 * **Multi-Transaction Exploitation**:
 * - Transaction 1: Call withdrawAll() â†’ sets pendingWithdrawals but triggers reentrancy
 * - Transaction 2: In callback, exploit inconsistent state (pending withdrawal marked but not cleared)
 * - Transaction 3+: Additional calls can compound the vulnerability through accumulated state manipulation
