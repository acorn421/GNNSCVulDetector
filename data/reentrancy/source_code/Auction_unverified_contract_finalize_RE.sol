 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a stateful, multi-transaction reentrancy vulnerability by reordering operations to place external calls before state updates. The vulnerability requires multiple transactions to exploit:
 * 
 * **SPECIFIC CHANGES MADE:**
 * 1. **Moved `finalized = true` to the END**: Now set after all external calls instead of first
 * 2. **Separated external calls from state cleanup**: External calls to bidders happen in first loop, state cleanup in second loop
 * 3. **Maintained bid values during external calls**: `bids[accountsList[i]]` remains non-zero during external calls, enabling reentrancy
 * 4. **Preserved beneficiary payment order**: Still happens early but now before any state protection
 * 
 * **MULTI-TRANSACTION EXPLOITATION SCENARIO:**
 * - **Transaction 1**: Owner calls `finalize()` â†’ External call to malicious bidder contract
 * - **Transaction 2**: Malicious bidder's fallback function re-enters `finalize()` (finalized still false)
 * - **Transaction 3**: Second re-entry continues, potentially calling other functions like `refund()`
 * - **State Accumulation**: Each re-entry can manipulate the auction state before `finalized` is set
 * 
 * **WHY MULTI-TRANSACTION IS REQUIRED:**
 * 1. **Stateful Protection**: The `finalized` flag persists across transactions and prevents re-execution
 * 2. **State Dependency**: Exploit requires `finalized` to remain false during external calls
 * 3. **Cross-Function Reentrancy**: Malicious contracts can call other functions during re-entry
 * 4. **Persistent State Changes**: Bid amounts and winner state persist between transactions, enabling complex attack sequences
 * 
 * **REALISTIC EXPLOITATION:**
 * A malicious bidder can deploy a contract that, when receiving refunds, re-enters the auction to manipulate the winner, drain additional funds, or exploit other state-dependent functions before the auction is properly finalized.
