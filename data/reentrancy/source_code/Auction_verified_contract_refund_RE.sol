 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a stateful, multi-transaction reentrancy vulnerability by replacing the gas-limited send() with call.value() which provides more gas and allows reentrancy. The vulnerability requires multiple transactions: (1) Initial bid transaction to populate bids[msg.sender] with funds, (2) Refund transaction with malicious contract that can re-enter during the call.value() execution before bids[msg.sender] is set to 0. The state persistence of the bids mapping between transactions enables the accumulated state exploitation pattern. The attacker's contract can recursively call refund() multiple times in the second transaction, draining more than their original bid amount before the state is finally updated.
