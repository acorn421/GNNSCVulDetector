 * 2. reentrancy-events (SWC-107)
 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a stateful, multi-transaction reentrancy vulnerability by adding an external call to the recipient address before state updates. The vulnerability requires multiple transactions to exploit:
 * 
 * **Changes Made:**
 * 1. Added external call to `_to.call()` with `onTokenReceived` callback after balance checks but before state updates
 * 2. Used low-level call to avoid reverting on failure, maintaining function flow
 * 3. Positioned the call to violate the Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern
 * 
 * **Multi-Transaction Exploitation:**
 * 1. **Transaction 1**: Attacker calls transferFrom with malicious contract as `_to`
 * 2. **During Callback**: Malicious contract receives onTokenReceived call before balances are updated
 * 3. **Reentrancy Chain**: Malicious contract calls transferFrom again with same allowance
 * 4. **Transaction 2+**: Each subsequent call exploits the fact that balances haven't been updated yet
 * 5. **State Accumulation**: Multiple transfers can occur before the first transaction completes state updates
 * 
 * **Why Multi-Transaction is Required:**
 * - Single transaction would have consistent state throughout execution
 * - Vulnerability depends on external contract's ability to make additional calls during callback
 * - Allowance mechanism limits single-transaction exploitation but accumulates across multiple calls
 * - State corruption builds up across transaction sequence, enabling balance drainage
 * 
 * **Realistic Attack Scenario:**
 * - Attacker sets up malicious contract with onTokenReceived function
 * - Attacker gets approval to transfer victim's tokens
 * - Attacker calls transferFrom with malicious contract as recipient
 * - Malicious contract recursively calls transferFrom during callback
 * - Each call transfers more tokens than allowance should permit due to delayed state updates
