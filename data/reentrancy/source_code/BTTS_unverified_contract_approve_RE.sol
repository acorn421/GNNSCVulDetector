/*
 * ===== SmartInject Injection Details =====
 * Function      : approve
 * Vulnerability : Reentrancy
 * Status        : Not Detected
 * Type          : Function Modification
 *
 * === Verification Results ===
 * Detected      : False
 * Relevant      : 0 findings
 * Total Found   : 0 issues
 * Retry Count   : 0
 *
 * === Description ===
 * **Changes Made:**
 * 1. **External Call Injection**: Added a callback mechanism (`IApprovalReceiver(_spender).onApprovalReceived()`) to notify spender contracts about approval changes
 * 2. **State Vulnerability**: The callback occurs BEFORE the allowance state is updated, creating a window for reentrancy exploitation
 * 3. **Contract Detection**: Added `_spender.code.length > 0` check to only call contracts (realistic pattern)
 * 
 * **Multi-Transaction Exploitation Sequence:**
 * 1. **Transaction 1**: User calls `approve(maliciousContract, 1000)` 
 *    - Function reaches the callback before setting allowance
 *    - Malicious contract's `onApprovalReceived` is called with old allowance state still intact
 *    - During callback, malicious contract can call `transferFrom` using any existing allowance
 *    - Or manipulate other approvals/transfers while approval state is inconsistent
 * 
 * 2. **Transaction 2+**: The malicious contract can continue exploiting:
 *    - Use the newly set allowance in combination with previously manipulated state
 *    - Chain multiple approve/transferFrom operations across transactions
 *    - Exploit the fact that the allowance was set after the callback, allowing for state manipulation
 * 
 * **Why Multi-Transaction is Required:**
 * - The vulnerability requires setting up malicious contract state in advance (separate deployment)
 * - Exploitation depends on accumulated allowance state from previous transactions
 * - The attack requires the attacker to first receive approval, then exploit it in subsequent calls
 * - State inconsistencies created during the callback can only be fully exploited across multiple transaction contexts
 * - The malicious contract needs to be pre-positioned with logic to exploit the callback timing
 * 
 * **Realistic Vulnerability Pattern:**
 * - Approval notifications are a legitimate DeFi pattern for automated trading systems
 * - The callback appears to be a useful feature for dApps to react to approval changes
 * - The vulnerability is subtle - the callback timing creates the security flaw
 * - This pattern has been seen in real-world protocols that try to add "hooks" to standard ERC20 operations
