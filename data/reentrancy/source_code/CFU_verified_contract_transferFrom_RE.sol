 *
 * === Detected Issues ===
 * 1. reentrancy-no-eth (SWC-107)
 * 2. reentrancy-events (SWC-107)
 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a stateful, multi-transaction reentrancy vulnerability by adding an external call to the recipient contract after balance updates but before allowance reduction. This creates a critical window where:
 * 
 * 1. **State Inconsistency**: Balances have been updated but allowances haven't been reduced yet
 * 2. **External Control**: The recipient contract can execute arbitrary code during the callback
 * 3. **Multi-Transaction Exploitation**: The vulnerability requires:
 *    - Transaction 1: Attacker sets up allowance and deploys malicious contract
 *    - Transaction 2: Initial transferFrom call triggers the callback, which can make reentrant calls
 *    - Transaction 3+: Additional reentrant transferFrom calls exploit the allowance that hasn't been reduced yet
 * 
 * **Exploitation Scenario:**
 * - Attacker gets approval for 1000 tokens
 * - Calls transferFrom(victim, attackerContract, 1000)
 * - During onTokenReceived callback, attacker's contract calls transferFrom again
 * - Since allowance reduction happens after the callback, the attacker can drain more tokens than originally approved
 * - Each reentrant call can transfer the full allowance amount before it gets reduced
 * 
 * **Multi-Transaction Requirement:**
 * - Cannot be exploited in a single transaction due to the need for pre-setup (approval)
 * - Requires persistent state (allowance) that accumulates across transactions
 * - The vulnerability depends on the sequence: approval → transfer → reentrancy → allowance reduction
 * 
 * The injection maintains the function's original behavior while introducing a realistic vulnerability pattern seen in token contracts that implement transfer hooks.
