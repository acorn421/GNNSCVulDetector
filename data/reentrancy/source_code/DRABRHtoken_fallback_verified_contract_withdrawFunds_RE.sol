 * Status        : Verified

 *
 * === Verification Results ===
 * Detected      : True

 * Retry Count   : 0
 *
 * === Detected Issues ===
 * 1. reentrancy-eth (SWC-107)
 *
 * === Description ===
 * This creates a stateful, multi-transaction reentrancy vulnerability where an attacker must first call requestWithdrawal() to set up the withdrawal state, wait for the cooling period, then call withdrawFunds() which makes an external call before updating the state. The vulnerability requires multiple transactions and persistent state changes between calls.
