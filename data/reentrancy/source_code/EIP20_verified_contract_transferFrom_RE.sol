 * 1. reentrancy-no-eth (SWC-107)
 * 2. reentrancy-events (SWC-107)
 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a stateful, multi-transaction reentrancy vulnerability by adding an external call to the recipient contract (`onTokenReceived`) after balance updates but before allowance updates. This creates a window where the contract state is inconsistent - balances have been updated but allowances haven't been decremented yet. The vulnerability requires multiple transactions to exploit: 1) Initial setup transactions to establish allowances and deploy malicious contracts, 2) Triggering transaction that initiates the transfer, 3) Reentrant calls during the callback that exploit the inconsistent state where allowances haven't been decremented but balances have been transferred. The attack exploits the fact that during the callback, the attacker can make additional `transferFrom` calls using the same allowance that hasn't been decremented yet, effectively allowing double-spending of the allowance across multiple transactions.
