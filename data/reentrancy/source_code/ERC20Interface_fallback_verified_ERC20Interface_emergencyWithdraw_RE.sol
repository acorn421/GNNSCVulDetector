 *
 * === Detected Issues ===
 * 1. reentrancy-eth (SWC-107)
 *
 * === Description ===
 * This vulnerability creates a stateful reentrancy attack that requires multiple transactions to exploit. First, an attacker must call requestEmergencyWithdrawal() to set up the withdrawal request and timestamp. Then, after the 24-hour waiting period, they can call emergencyWithdraw() which makes an external call before updating the state variables. The attacker can reenter the function during the external call, repeatedly withdrawing funds before the state is cleared. This is a multi-transaction vulnerability because it requires: 1) Initial setup call to requestEmergencyWithdrawal(), 2) Waiting period, 3) Exploitation call to emergencyWithdraw() with reentrancy attack contract.
