 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a stateful, multi-transaction reentrancy vulnerability by adding withdrawal tracking state variables that persist between transactions. The vulnerability requires multiple function calls to exploit:
 * 
 * **Specific Changes Made:**
 * 1. Added `withdrawalAttempts` mapping to track attempts per address across transactions
 * 2. Added `lastWithdrawalTime` mapping to implement time-based withdrawal logic
 * 3. Added `partialWithdrawalEnabled` mapping to enable different withdrawal modes
 * 4. Implemented partial withdrawal logic that activates after 3 attempts
 * 5. Moved state updates AFTER the external `transfer()` call, creating classic reentrancy vulnerability
 * 
 * **Multi-Transaction Exploitation Process:**
 * 1. **Transaction 1-2**: Attacker calls GetGift() normally, incrementing withdrawalAttempts
 * 2. **Transaction 3**: After 3 attempts, partialWithdrawalEnabled becomes true
 * 3. **Transaction 4+**: Attacker can now exploit reentrancy in partial withdrawal mode:
 *    - During transfer(), attacker's fallback function is called
 *    - Attacker can re-enter GetGift() before state variables are updated
 *    - Since partialWithdrawalEnabled is still true and state hasn't been reset, attacker can drain more funds
 *    - State variables (withdrawalAttempts, partialWithdrawalEnabled) only reset after full withdrawal, not partial
 * 
 * **Why Multiple Transactions Are Required:**
 * - The vulnerability relies on accumulated state (withdrawalAttempts â‰¥ 3) that persists between transactions
 * - Partial withdrawal mode must be enabled first through multiple legitimate calls
 * - The reentrancy exploitation depends on the partialWithdrawalEnabled state being true, which only occurs after transaction history
 * - Single transaction exploitation is impossible because the state accumulation (3 attempts) cannot occur atomically
 * 
 * **Realistic Attack Scenario:**
 * An attacker would need to make 3 legitimate calls to build up their withdrawal attempt count, then exploit the reentrancy vulnerability in subsequent transactions when partial withdrawals are enabled. The vulnerability appears as a "security feature" limiting withdrawals but actually creates a multi-transaction attack vector.
