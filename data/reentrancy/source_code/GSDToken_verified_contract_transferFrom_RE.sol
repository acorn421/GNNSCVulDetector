 * 2. reentrancy-events (SWC-107)
 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a stateful, multi-transaction reentrancy vulnerability by adding an external call to the recipient contract (_to.call()) before state updates. This creates a classic reentrancy vulnerability where:
 * 
 * 1. **Multi-Transaction Setup Required**: An attacker must first set up allowances through approve() calls in separate transactions to create the necessary state for exploitation.
 * 
 * 2. **Stateful Exploitation**: The vulnerability exploits the persistent state of allowances and balances across multiple transactions. The attacker's malicious contract can re-enter transferFrom() while the original call's state updates are still pending.
 * 
 * 3. **External Call Before State Updates**: The external call to notify the recipient occurs before critical state variables (balances, allowed) are updated, violating the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern.
 * 
 * 4. **Multi-Transaction Exploitation Path**:
 *    - Transaction 1: Victim calls approve() to grant allowance to attacker
 *    - Transaction 2: Attacker calls transferFrom() â†’ triggers external call to malicious recipient contract
 *    - During external call: Malicious contract re-enters transferFrom() using the same allowance (still not decremented)
 *    - Multiple transfers can occur using the same allowance before state is updated
 * 
 * 5. **Persistent State Dependencies**: The vulnerability depends on the allowance state persisting between the initial external call and the state updates, enabling multiple withdrawals against the same allowance approval.
 * 
 * The vulnerability is realistic as recipient notifications are common in modern token standards, and the state persistence across multiple transactions makes it a genuine multi-transaction reentrancy vulnerability.
