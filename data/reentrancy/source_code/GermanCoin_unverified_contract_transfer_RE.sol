 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a stateful, multi-transaction reentrancy vulnerability by adding an external call to the recipient address before balance updates. The vulnerability requires multiple transactions to exploit:
 * 
 * **Specific Changes Made:**
 * 1. Added external call to `TokenReceiver(_to).onTokenReceived()` before balance state updates
 * 2. Used try-catch to handle callback failures gracefully (realistic production pattern)
 * 3. Maintained all original function logic and behavior
 * 
 * **Multi-Transaction Exploitation Path:**
 * 1. **Transaction 1**: Attacker deploys malicious contract implementing TokenReceiver
 * 2. **Transaction 2**: Victim calls transfer() to malicious contract, triggering onTokenReceived callback
 * 3. **During callback**: Malicious contract can call transfer() again, but cannot immediately exploit due to balance checks
 * 4. **Transaction 3+**: Attacker exploits the state inconsistency where the callback executed but balances haven't been updated yet, allowing manipulation of the transfer logic through accumulated state changes
 * 
 * **Why Multiple Transactions Are Required:**
 * - The vulnerability creates a window between external call execution and state updates
 * - Initial transaction establishes the callback mechanism in the malicious contract
 * - Subsequent transactions exploit the timing difference between callback execution and balance updates
 * - The attacker needs to accumulate state changes across multiple calls to bypass balance requirements
 * - Single transaction exploitation is prevented by the balance validation checks that occur before the external call
 * 
 * The vulnerability is realistic as many DeFi protocols implement similar callback mechanisms for token transfers, making this a common attack vector in production systems.
