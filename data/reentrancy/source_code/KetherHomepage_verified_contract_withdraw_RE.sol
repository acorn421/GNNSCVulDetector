 * Relevant      : 1 findings
 * Total Found   : 3 issues
 * Retry Count   : 0
 *
 * === Detected Issues ===
 * 1. reentrancy-eth (SWC-107)
 *
 * === Description ===
 * This modification introduces a stateful, multi-transaction reentrancy vulnerability by:
 * 
 * 1. **State Variables Added**: 
 *    - `pendingWithdrawals` mapping tracks pending withdrawal amounts
 *    - `withdrawalInProgress` flag indicates withdrawal state
 *    - `totalPendingAmount` accumulates total pending withdrawals
 * 
 * 2. **Multi-Transaction Exploitation Pattern**:
 *    - **Transaction 1**: Contract owner calls withdraw(), setting withdrawalInProgress=true and recording pending amount
 *    - **Transaction 2**: During the external call, if withdrawWallet is a malicious contract, it can re-enter withdraw()
 *    - **Transaction 3+**: The malicious contract can continue calling withdraw() while pendingWithdrawals state persists
 * 
 * 3. **Vulnerability Mechanics**:
 *    - The external call `withdrawWallet.call.value()` happens before proper state cleanup
 *    - `pendingWithdrawals[withdrawWallet]` is never reset to 0 after successful withdrawal
 *    - The `withdrawalInProgress` flag is reset after the external call, creating a vulnerable window
 *    - Multiple withdrawals can be processed against the same pending amount
 * 
 * 4. **Multi-Transaction Requirement**: 
 *    - The vulnerability requires the withdrawWallet to be a malicious contract with fallback/receive function
 *    - The first transaction sets up the vulnerable state
 *    - Subsequent reentrancy calls exploit the persistent state across multiple transaction contexts
 *    - The exploit accumulates over multiple calls as pendingWithdrawals state persists
 * 
 * 5. **Exploitation Scenario**:
 *    - Owner calls withdraw() â†’ sets pending state and calls external contract
 *    - Malicious withdrawWallet contract receives funds and immediately calls withdraw() again
 *    - Since pendingWithdrawals wasn't reset, second call processes the same amount again
 *    - This can continue until contract balance is drained
 * 
 * This creates a realistic reentrancy vulnerability that requires multiple transactions and persistent state to exploit, making it stateful and multi-transaction dependent.
