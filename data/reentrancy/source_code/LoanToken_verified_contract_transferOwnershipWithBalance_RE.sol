 *
 * === Detected Issues ===
 * 1. reentrancy-no-eth (SWC-107)
 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a stateful, multi-transaction reentrancy vulnerability by adding an external call to the new owner's contract before updating the owner state variable. This creates a Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern violation where:
 * 
 * 1. **Transaction 1**: Owner calls transferOwnershipWithBalance with malicious contract address
 * 2. **External Call**: The malicious contract receives onOwnershipTransferred callback with balance information
 * 3. **Reentrancy Window**: During callback, the balance has been transferred but ownership hasn't been updated yet
 * 4. **Transaction 2+**: Malicious contract can reenter the original contract while in this inconsistent state
 * 
 * The vulnerability is stateful because:
 * - The balance transfer creates persistent state changes
 * - The ownership transfer happens after the external call
 * - Multiple transactions can exploit the temporary inconsistent state
 * - The attacker can accumulate actions across multiple calls during the reentrancy window
 * 
 * This requires multiple transactions because the attacker needs to:
 * 1. First transaction: Trigger the initial ownership transfer
 * 2. During callback: Use the reentrancy window to call other contract functions
 * 3. Subsequent transactions: Continue exploiting the inconsistent state before ownership is finalized
 * 
 * The vulnerability is realistic as notification callbacks are common in ownership transfer patterns, and the timing of state updates creates a genuine multi-transaction attack surface.
