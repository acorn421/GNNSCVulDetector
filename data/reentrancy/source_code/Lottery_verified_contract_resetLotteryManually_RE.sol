 * ===== SmartInject Injection Details =====
 * Function      : resetLotteryManually
 * Vulnerability : Reentrancy
 * Status        : Verified
 * Type          : Function Modification
 *
 * === Verification Results ===
 * Detected      : True
 * Relevant      : 2 findings
 * Total Found   : 7 issues
 * Retry Count   : 0
 *
 * === Detected Issues ===
 * 1. reentrancy-eth (SWC-107)
 * 2. reentrancy-benign (SWC-107)
 *
 * === Description ===
 * This modification introduces a stateful, multi-transaction reentrancy vulnerability by:
 * 
 * 1. **External Call Before State Updates**: Added calls to `revContract.exit()` and `owner.transfer()` before updating the critical state variables (`ticketNumber` and `winningNumber`), violating the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern.
 * 
 * 2. **Multi-Transaction Exploitation Path**:
 *    - **Transaction 1**: Owner calls `resetLotteryManually()` when REV tokens/dividends exist
 *    - **During External Call**: The `revContract.exit()` or `owner.transfer()` triggers a callback to a malicious contract
 *    - **Reentrant Call**: Malicious contract re-enters `resetLotteryManually()` before state updates complete
 *    - **State Inconsistency**: The reentrant call sees old `ticketNumber` and `winningNumber` values, allowing manipulation of lottery state
 *    - **Transaction 2+**: Subsequent legitimate transactions operate on inconsistent state created by the reentrancy
 * 
 * 3. **Stateful Dependencies**: The vulnerability depends on:
 *    - Accumulated REV tokens/dividends from previous lottery rounds
 *    - The timing of when the owner calls the reset function
 *    - The persistent state of `ticketNumber` and `winningNumber` across transactions
 * 
 * 4. **Realistic Integration**: The added functionality appears legitimate - liquidating REV tokens and transferring funds during a manual reset is a reasonable operation for lottery maintenance.
 * 
 * 5. **Multi-Transaction Requirement**: The vulnerability cannot be exploited in a single transaction because:
 *    - It requires prior state accumulation (REV tokens/dividends)
 *    - The reentrancy window only exists during external calls
 *    - Exploitation requires coordinated timing across multiple transactions
 *    - The malicious contract must be positioned to receive callbacks from the REV contract or owner transfer
