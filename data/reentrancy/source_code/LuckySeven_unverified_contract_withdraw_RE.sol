 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a stateful, multi-transaction reentrancy vulnerability by moving the state update (withdrawals mapping) to AFTER the external call (msg.sender.transfer). This creates a classic reentrancy vulnerability where:
 * 
 * **Multi-Transaction Exploitation Process:**
 * 1. **Transaction 1**: Attacker makes initial investment via buy() function to establish joined[attacker] > 0 and build up balance
 * 2. **Transaction 2**: Attacker calls withdraw() which triggers the vulnerable flow:
 *    - getBalance() calculates available balance based on time elapsed and previous withdrawals
 *    - transfer() is called, which triggers attacker's fallback function
 *    - In the fallback, attacker can call withdraw() again BEFORE withdrawals[attacker] is updated
 *    - This allows multiple withdrawals of the same calculated balance
 * 3. **Transaction 3+**: Attacker can repeat the reentrancy attack across multiple blocks/transactions since the state corruption persists
 * 
 * **Why Multi-Transaction Nature is Required:**
 * - Initial investment must occur in a separate transaction to establish the joined timestamp
 * - The vulnerability exploits the time-based balance calculation that accumulates over multiple blocks
 * - Each successful reentrancy attack affects the persistent withdrawals state, enabling continued exploitation
 * - The getBalance() calculation depends on time elapsed since joined[address], requiring real time passage between transactions
 * 
 * **State Persistence Vulnerability:**
 * - The withdrawals mapping acts as a cumulative counter that persists across transactions
 * - By updating this state AFTER the external call, an attacker can manipulate the balance calculation across multiple transactions
 * - Each successful attack compounds the vulnerability by corrupting the withdrawal history
 * 
 * This vulnerability requires the attacker to interact with the contract across multiple transactions and blocks, making it a realistic stateful reentrancy attack.
