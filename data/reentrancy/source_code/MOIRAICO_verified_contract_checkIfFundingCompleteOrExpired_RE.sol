 * ... and 4 more
 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a reentrancy vulnerability by adding an external call to the beneficiary address before critical state changes. The vulnerability is stateful and multi-transaction because:
 * 
 * 1. **Multi-Transaction Exploitation Pattern**:
 *    - Transaction 1: Attacker calls checkIfFundingCompleteOrExpired() when ICO deadline has passed
 *    - During the external call beneficiary.call.value(0)(""), the attacker's malicious contract re-enters
 *    - Re-entrant calls can manipulate state while the function is mid-execution
 *    - Transaction 2+: Subsequent calls exploit the inconsistent state created during reentrancy
 * 
 * 2. **State Persistence Requirements**:
 *    - The vulnerability relies on the persistent state variables (state, completedAt, totalRaised)
 *    - Multiple transactions are needed to set up the conditions (ICO deadline passing)
 *    - The exploit requires accumulated state from previous ICO operations
 *    - State changes persist between transactions, enabling multi-call exploitation
 * 
 * 3. **Realistic Integration**:
 *    - Added external call appears as legitimate oracle/notification mechanism
 *    - Maintains original function behavior and signature
 *    - External call uses low-level call() which is common in older Solidity versions
 *    - The timing of the external call before state changes is a realistic oversight
 * 
 * 4. **Exploitation Mechanics**:
 *    - Attacker deploys malicious contract as beneficiary
 *    - When ICO deadline passes, checkIfFundingCompleteOrExpired() is called
 *    - During beneficiary.call(), attacker re-enters and can call contribute() or other functions
 *    - State inconsistency allows manipulation of token distribution or fund extraction
 *    - Multiple re-entrant calls can drain funds or manipulate final ICO state
 * 
 * This creates a genuine multi-transaction reentrancy vulnerability that requires ICO state accumulation and enables sophisticated exploitation through persistent state manipulation.
