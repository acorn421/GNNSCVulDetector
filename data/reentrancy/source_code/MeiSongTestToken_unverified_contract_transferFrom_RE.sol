 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a stateful, multi-transaction reentrancy vulnerability by adding an external call to the recipient address before the allowance is decremented. This creates a window where the allowance state remains unchanged during the external call, enabling multi-transaction exploitation.
 * 
 * **Specific Changes Made:**
 * 1. Added a check for contract code at the recipient address (`_to.code.length > 0`)
 * 2. Inserted an external call to `_to.call(abi.encodeWithSignature("onTokenReceived(address,address,uint256)", _from, _to, _value))`
 * 3. Positioned this external call AFTER balance updates but BEFORE allowance decrement
 * 4. Added a require statement to handle call failures
 * 
 * **Multi-Transaction Exploitation Scenario:**
 * Transaction 1 (Setup): Attacker gets approval for X tokens from victim
 * Transaction 2 (Initial Attack): Attacker calls transferFrom() with malicious contract as _to
 * - During the external call to malicious contract's onTokenReceived()
 * - The malicious contract re-enters transferFrom() before allowance is decremented
 * - Second transferFrom() call sees the same allowance value and succeeds
 * Transaction 3 (Completion): Both transfers complete, draining 2X tokens using only X allowance
 * 
 * **Why Multi-Transaction is Required:**
 * - The vulnerability requires persistent allowance state between the initial call and reentrancy
 * - The external call creates a stateful window where allowance remains unchanged
 * - Multiple transferFrom() calls are needed to exploit the allowance double-spending
 * - The attack spans across the initial transaction and the reentrant call, requiring state persistence
 * 
 * **Realistic Attack Vector:**
 * An attacker would deploy a malicious contract that implements onTokenReceived() to immediately call transferFrom() again, effectively doubling their withdrawal while only consuming the allowance once. This pattern mimics real-world token standards like ERC777 that include recipient hooks, making the vulnerability subtle and realistic.
