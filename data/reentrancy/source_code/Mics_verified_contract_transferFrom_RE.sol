 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a stateful, multi-transaction reentrancy vulnerability by adding an external call to the recipient address before updating the allowance state. This creates a window where the allowance hasn't been decremented yet, allowing malicious contracts to exploit the vulnerability across multiple transactions.
 * 
 * **Specific Changes Made:**
 * 1. Added a conditional external call to `_to.call()` that invokes `onTokenReceived` if the recipient is a contract
 * 2. Moved the allowance state update (`allowance[_from][msg.sender] -= _value`) to occur AFTER the external call
 * 3. The external call happens before state changes, creating a classic reentrancy vulnerability
 * 
 * **Multi-Transaction Exploitation Scenario:**
 * 
 * **Transaction 1 (Setup):**
 * - User approves attacker contract for 100 tokens: `approve(attackerContract, 100)`
 * - Allowance state: `allowance[user][attackerContract] = 100`
 * 
 * **Transaction 2 (Initial Attack):**
 * - Attacker calls `transferFrom(user, maliciousContract, 50)`
 * - Flow: allowance check passes (50 <= 100) â†’ external call to maliciousContract.onTokenReceived()
 * - During the external call, the malicious contract reenters and calls `transferFrom(user, anotherAddress, 50)` again
 * - The second call passes the allowance check (50 <= 100) because allowance hasn't been decremented yet
 * - Result: 100 tokens transferred using only 50 tokens of allowance
 * 
 * **Transaction 3 (Potential Further Exploitation):**
 * - If any allowance remains, the pattern can be repeated across multiple transactions
 * - Each transaction can exploit the time window between allowance check and allowance update
 * 
 * **Why Multi-Transaction is Required:**
 * 1. **State Persistence**: The allowance mapping persists between transactions, creating opportunities for accumulated exploitation
 * 2. **Reentrancy Window**: The vulnerability exists in the window between the allowance check and the allowance update, which can be exploited multiple times
 * 3. **Stateful Nature**: The attack relies on the allowance state not being properly updated before external calls, requiring multiple function calls to fully exploit
 * 4. **Incremental Exploitation**: Each transaction can potentially drain more tokens than the allowance should permit, with the full impact realized across multiple calls
 * 
 * This creates a realistic reentrancy vulnerability that requires multiple transactions to be fully exploited, as the attacker needs to set up allowances and then exploit them across multiple calls to maximize the damage.
