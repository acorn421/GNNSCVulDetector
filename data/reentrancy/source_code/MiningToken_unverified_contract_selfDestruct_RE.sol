 * Function      : selfDestruct
 * Vulnerability : Reentrancy
 * Status        : Not Detected

 *
 * === Verification Results ===
 * Detected      : False
 * Relevant      : 0 findings
 * Total Found   : 0 issues
 * Retry Count   : 0
 *
 * === Description ===
 * This modification introduces a stateful, multi-transaction reentrancy vulnerability by:
 * 
 * 1. **State Variables Added**: Added `refundProcessed` mapping to track which holders have received refunds, and `refundInProgress` boolean to track the destruction process state.
 * 
 * 2. **Multi-Transaction Design**: The function now allows multiple calls by only executing `selfdestruct()` after all refunds are processed, making it naturally multi-transaction.
 * 
 * 3. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**: The critical flaw is in the loop where `holder.transfer()` is called BEFORE setting `refundProcessed[holder] = true`. This creates a classic reentrancy vulnerability.
 * 
 * **Multi-Transaction Exploitation Process:**
 * 
 * **Transaction 1 (Setup)**: Owner calls `selfDestruct()` â†’ sets `refundInProgress = true` and starts processing refunds.
 * 
 * **Transaction 2 (Attack)**: Malicious contract (deployed by an attacker who somehow became a holder) receives the transfer call. In its fallback function, it:
 * - Re-enters `selfDestruct()` 
 * - Since `refundProcessed[attacker]` is still `false` (not updated yet), it receives another transfer
 * - This can be repeated multiple times within the same transaction
 * 
 * **Transaction 3+ (Continuation)**: The attacker can continue calling `selfDestruct()` in subsequent transactions as long as the contract hasn't been destroyed and their `refundProcessed` status hasn't been properly updated.
 * 
 * **Why Multi-Transaction is Required:**
 * - The vulnerability requires the contract to be in the `refundInProgress` state (set in first transaction)
 * - Each subsequent transaction can exploit the race condition between the transfer call and the state update
 * - The attacker needs multiple transactions to drain significant funds before the contract is destroyed
 * - State persistence between transactions (`refundProcessed` and `refundInProgress`) enables the continued exploitation
 * 
 * This creates a realistic scenario where an attacker could receive multiple refunds by exploiting the timing between external calls and state updates across multiple transactions.
