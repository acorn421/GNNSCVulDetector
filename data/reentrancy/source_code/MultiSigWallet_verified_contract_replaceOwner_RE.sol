 * ===== SmartInject Injection Details =====
 * Function      : replaceOwner
 * Vulnerability : Reentrancy
 * Status        : Verified
 * Type          : Function Modification
 *
 * === Verification Results ===
 * Detected      : True
 * Relevant      : 3 findings
 * Total Found   : 4 issues
 * Retry Count   : 0
 *
 * === Detected Issues ===
 * 1. reentrancy-no-eth (SWC-107)
 * 2. reentrancy-benign (SWC-107)
 * 3. reentrancy-events (SWC-107)
 *
 * === Description ===
 * **Specific Changes Made:**
 * 
 * 1. **Added External Call Before State Updates**: Introduced a call to `owner.call()` to notify the old owner of the impending replacement BEFORE any state changes occur
 * 2. **State Changes After External Call**: Moved all critical state modifications (owners array update, isOwner mapping changes) to occur AFTER the external call to the old owner
 * 3. **Second External Call**: Added another external call to notify the new owner after state changes, creating a second reentrancy window
 * 4. **Removed Reentrancy Protection**: No nonReentrant modifier or checks-effects-interactions pattern implemented
 * 
 * **Multi-Transaction Exploitation Process:**
 * 
 * **Phase 1 - Setup (Transaction 1):**
 * - Attacker deploys a malicious contract that implements the `onOwnershipTransfer` callback
 * - Attacker becomes a legitimate owner through normal multisig processes
 * - Attacker initiates a `replaceOwner` transaction to replace themselves with the malicious contract address
 * 
 * **Phase 2 - Exploitation (Transaction 2 - Reentrancy):**
 * - When `replaceOwner` is called, it triggers the external call to the old owner (attacker's malicious contract)
 * - The malicious contract's `onOwnershipTransfer` callback is executed BEFORE state changes
 * - During this callback, the attacker can:
 *   - Call `replaceOwner` again to replace other owners with attacker-controlled addresses
 *   - The `ownerExists(owner)` check still passes because `isOwner[owner]` is still true
 *   - The `ownerDoesNotExist(newOwner)` check passes for different addresses
 *   - Multiple owners can be replaced in a single reentrancy chain
 * 
 * **Phase 3 - State Corruption (Ongoing):**
 * - After reentrancy, the ownership state becomes inconsistent
 * - The same malicious address might appear multiple times in the owners array
 * - Legitimate owners might be removed from the array but still marked as owners in isOwner mapping
 * - The attacker gains disproportionate control over the multisig wallet
 * 
 * **Why Multi-Transaction Requirement:**
 * 
 * 1. **Setup Dependency**: The attacker must first become a legitimate owner, which requires separate transactions for multisig approval
 * 2. **State Accumulation**: The vulnerability exploits the accumulated ownership state from previous transactions
 * 3. **Persistent State Changes**: Each reentrancy call creates persistent state changes that affect subsequent operations
 * 4. **Cross-Transaction Dependencies**: The exploit relies on the combination of legitimate ownership (from previous transactions) and the reentrancy window (in current transaction)
 * 
 * **Realistic Attack Impact:**
 * - Attacker can gain majority control of the multisig wallet
 * - Subsequent transactions can be approved by attacker-controlled addresses
 * - The wallet's security model is fundamentally compromised
 * - Other contracts depending on this multisig's ownership structure are affected
