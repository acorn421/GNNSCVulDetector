 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a stateful, multi-transaction reentrancy vulnerability by adding a progressive withdrawal mechanism that tracks attempts per recipient. The vulnerability requires multiple transactions to exploit:
 * 
 * **Specific Changes Made:**
 * 1. **Added State Variables**: Three new mappings to track withdrawal attempts, timestamps, and maximum attempts per recipient
 * 2. **Progressive Unlock Logic**: Recipients can only withdraw portions of balance (33%, 50%, 100%) across multiple attempts
 * 3. **State Tracking**: Each call increments attempt counter and tracks recipient interaction
 * 4. **Vulnerable External Call**: Transfer occurs before state cleanup, enabling reentrancy
 * 5. **State Cleanup After Transfer**: Critical state reset only happens after successful transfer
 * 
 * **Multi-Transaction Exploitation Path:**
 * 1. **Transaction 1**: Attacker calls lastChance(), gets 33% of balance, attempt counter becomes 1
 * 2. **Transaction 2**: Attacker calls lastChance() again, gets 50% of remaining balance, attempt counter becomes 2  
 * 3. **Transaction 3**: Attacker calls lastChance() with reentrancy attack - during the transfer call, they re-enter lastChance() before state cleanup occurs
 * 4. **Reentrancy**: Since state cleanup happens after transfer, the attempt counter and timestamp are still set from previous calls, allowing the attacker to bypass the progressive limits and drain remaining funds
 * 
 * **Why Multi-Transaction Required:**
 * - The vulnerability builds on state accumulated across multiple legitimate calls
 * - Each transaction increases the withdrawal limit based on attempt history
 * - The final exploitation requires the state persistence from previous transactions
 * - Single-transaction attacks cannot establish the necessary attempt history to reach the vulnerable state where significant funds can be drained through reentrancy
 * 
 * The vulnerability is realistic as it mimics emergency withdrawal mechanisms that might legitimately require multiple confirmations or progressive unlocks for security reasons.
