 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a stateful, multi-transaction reentrancy vulnerability by adding an external call to the recipient address before state updates. This creates a classic Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern violation where:
 * 
 * 1. **Multi-Transaction Setup**: An attacker first needs to set up allowances and deploy a malicious contract recipient
 * 2. **State Accumulation**: The vulnerability exploits the fact that balances and allowances are checked before the external call but updated after
 * 3. **Reentrancy Attack**: The malicious recipient contract can call back into transferFrom during the callback, re-entering with the same initial state values
 * 
 * **Exploitation Sequence:**
 * - **Transaction 1**: Attacker gets approval/allowance from a victim account
 * - **Transaction 2**: Attacker calls transferFrom with malicious contract as recipient
 * - **During Transaction 2**: Malicious contract receives onTokenReceived callback and re-enters transferFrom before state updates
 * - **Result**: Multiple withdrawals against the same initial balance/allowance state
 * 
 * **Why Multi-Transaction**: The vulnerability requires prior allowance setup and depends on accumulated state from the approval mechanism. The reentrancy can only drain funds up to the approved allowance, making it a stateful attack that depends on permissions granted in previous transactions.
 * 
 * The external call to a user-controlled contract before state updates creates the classic reentrancy window, while maintaining the token's intended functionality of notifying recipient contracts.
