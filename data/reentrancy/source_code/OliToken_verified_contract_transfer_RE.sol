 * 1. reentrancy-events (SWC-107)
 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a stateful, multi-transaction reentrancy vulnerability by adding an external call to notify recipient contracts after balance updates. The vulnerability requires multiple transactions to exploit: 1) Attacker deploys a malicious contract that implements onTokenReceived() to reenter the transfer function, 2) Legitimate users transfer tokens to the malicious contract, triggering the callback, 3) The malicious contract reenters transfer() during the callback, potentially draining funds through accumulated balance manipulations across multiple reentrancy cycles. The vulnerability is stateful because it depends on the persistent balance state changes that occur between transactions, and multi-transaction because the exploit requires setting up the malicious contract first, then having tokens transferred to it to trigger the reentrancy chain. The external call occurs after balance updates but before the Transfer event, following the classic reentrancy pattern where state changes happen before external interactions complete.
