 * ===== SmartInject Injection Details =====
 * Function      : executeProposal
 * Vulnerability : Reentrancy
 * Status        : Verified
 * Type          : Function Modification
 *
 * === Verification Results ===
 * Detected      : True
 * Relevant      : 3 findings
 * Total Found   : 12 issues
 * Retry Count   : 0
 *
 * === Detected Issues ===
 * 1. reentrancy-eth (SWC-107)
 * 2. reentrancy-no-eth (SWC-107)
 * 3. reentrancy-events (SWC-107)
 *
 * === Description ===
 * This stateful, multi-transaction reentrancy vulnerability is created by reordering the external call and state updates, violating the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. The external call to p.recipient occurs before setting p.executed = true, allowing an attacker to exploit the inconsistent state across multiple transactions.
 * 
 * **Multi-Transaction Exploitation Scenario:**
 * 
 * 1. **Transaction 1 (Initial Call)**: Attacker calls executeProposal() with a malicious recipient contract
 * 2. **Transaction 2 (Reentrant Call)**: The malicious recipient contract reenters executeProposal() during the external call
 * 3. **State Exploitation**: In the reentrant call, p.executed is still false, so the same proposal can be executed multiple times
 * 
 * **Why Multi-Transaction is Required:**
 * 
 * - **Transaction 1**: Sets up the initial execution context and triggers the external call
 * - **Transaction 2**: Exploits the reentrancy during the callback, when state is inconsistent
 * - **State Persistence**: The vulnerability relies on the persistent state of p.executed remaining false during the external call, allowing multiple executions
 * - **Accumulated Effect**: Each reentrant call can drain additional funds or manipulate proposal states before the protection is finally set
 * 
 * The vulnerability requires multiple transactions because the exploit depends on the timing between the external call and state updates, creating a window where the same proposal can be executed multiple times across different call contexts.
