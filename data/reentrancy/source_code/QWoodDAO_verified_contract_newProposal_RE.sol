 * ===== SmartInject Injection Details =====
 * Function      : newProposal
 * Vulnerability : Reentrancy
 * Status        : Verified
 * Type          : Function Modification
 *
 * === Verification Results ===
 * Detected      : True
 * Relevant      : 6 findings
 * Total Found   : 13 issues
 * Retry Count   : 0
 *
 * === Detected Issues ===
 * 1. reentrancy-eth (SWC-107)
 * 2. reentrancy-no-eth (SWC-107)
 * 3. reentrancy-benign (SWC-107)
 * ... and 3 more
 *
 * === Description ===
 * **Specific Changes Made:**
 * 
 * 1. **Added External Call**: Introduced a `beneficiary.call()` that notifies the beneficiary about the proposal creation
 * 2. **Moved State Update**: The `numProposals` counter is now updated BEFORE the external call, violating the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern
 * 3. **Created Reentrancy Window**: The external call allows the beneficiary to reenter the function while the contract is in an inconsistent state
 * 
 * **Multi-Transaction Exploitation Scenario:**
 * 
 * **Transaction 1: Initial Setup**
 * - Attacker deploys a malicious contract that will be used as the beneficiary
 * - The malicious contract implements a `proposalNotification` function that triggers reentrancy
 * 
 * **Transaction 2: Reentrancy Attack**
 * - Attacker calls `newProposal()` with their malicious contract as beneficiary
 * - During execution:
 *   1. `proposalID` is set to `proposals.length` (e.g., 5)
 *   2. Proposal struct is created and populated
 *   3. `numProposals` is updated to `proposalID+1` (6)
 *   4. External call to malicious beneficiary triggers reentrancy
 *   5. Malicious contract calls `newProposal()` again during the callback
 *   6. New proposal gets `proposalID` = 6 (using the updated `numProposals`)
 *   7. But `proposals.length` is still 5, creating inconsistent state
 * 
 * **Transaction 3+: State Corruption Exploitation**
 * - The attacker can now exploit the inconsistent state between `numProposals` and `proposals.length`
 * - Multiple proposals can be created that reference the same array index
 * - This can lead to proposal overwrites or access to uninitialized memory
 * 
 * **Why Multi-Transaction is Required:**
 * 
 * 1. **State Accumulation**: The vulnerability requires building up inconsistent state across multiple calls
 * 2. **Reentrancy Depth**: The malicious contract needs to establish a callback mechanism first, then exploit it
 * 3. **Timing Dependency**: The exploit depends on the specific timing of when `numProposals` is updated vs when the external call occurs
 * 4. **Persistent State Corruption**: The corrupted state persists between transactions, enabling further exploitation
 * 
 * The vulnerability cannot be exploited in a single transaction because:
 * - The malicious contract must be deployed first
 * - The reentrancy requires a callback mechanism that spans multiple call frames
 * - The state corruption builds up over multiple proposal creations
 * - The exploit value comes from the persistent inconsistent state between transactions
