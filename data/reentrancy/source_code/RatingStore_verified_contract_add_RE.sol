 * === Detected Issues ===
 * 1. reentrancy-no-eth (SWC-107)
 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a stateful, multi-transaction reentrancy vulnerability by adding an external call to notify the target address about rating updates before state modifications. This creates a classic reentrancy vulnerability where:
 * 
 * 1. **External Call Before State Update**: The function calls `target.call(abi.encodeWithSignature("onRatingAdded(int256)", wScore))` before updating the cumulative score and total ratings
 * 2. **Stateful Exploitation**: Each reentrant call persistently modifies the attacker's score in contract storage
 * 3. **Multi-Transaction Requirement**: The vulnerability requires multiple transactions because:
 *    - First transaction: Attacker calls `add()` with their malicious contract as target
 *    - During callback: Malicious contract's `onRatingAdded()` function calls back into `add()` multiple times
 *    - Each reentrant call: Increments `cumulativeScore` and `totalRatings` before the original call completes
 *    - State persists: Each increment is stored permanently in the contract's state
 * 
 * The attacker can implement a malicious contract that, when its `onRatingAdded()` callback is triggered, calls back into `add()` multiple times to inflate their cumulative score. Since state updates happen after the external call, the attacker can accumulate multiple rating additions in a single transaction, but the vulnerability manifests across the sequence of reentrant calls that modify persistent state.
 * 
 * This is realistic because rating notification callbacks are common in reputation systems, and the code change appears innocuous while creating a serious vulnerability.
