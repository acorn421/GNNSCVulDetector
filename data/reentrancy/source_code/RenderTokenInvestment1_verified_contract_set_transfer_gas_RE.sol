 * 1. reentrancy-no-eth (SWC-107)
 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a stateful, multi-transaction reentrancy vulnerability by adding an external call to a gas_manager address before updating the gas state variable. This creates a classic violation of the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. The vulnerability requires multiple transactions to exploit: 1) First, the attacker must set themselves as the gas_manager through another function or initial setup, 2) Then, when set_transfer_gas is called, the external call to gas_manager allows the attacker to re-enter the contract and manipulate the gas value or exploit the inconsistent state where the old gas value is still in effect during the external call. The persistent state change (gas_manager address) from previous transactions enables the reentrancy attack in subsequent calls to set_transfer_gas, making this a genuine multi-transaction vulnerability that cannot be exploited in a single atomic transaction.
