 * 2. reentrancy-benign (SWC-107)
 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a stateful, multi-transaction reentrancy vulnerability by moving the balance update (balances[msg.sender] = 0) to occur AFTER the external token.transfer() call. This creates a vulnerable window where a malicious token contract can call back into perform_withdrawal while the user's balance is still non-zero, potentially allowing multiple withdrawals before the balance is finally zeroed. The vulnerability is stateful because it depends on the user having a non-zero balance from previous transactions (depositing ETH and tokens being bought), and multi-transaction because it requires: 1) Initial ETH deposit, 2) Token purchase by owner, 3) Malicious token deployment, 4) Vulnerable withdrawal with reentrancy callback. The realistic comment change makes it appear as an optimization to "prevent double withdrawal" but actually enables the attack.
