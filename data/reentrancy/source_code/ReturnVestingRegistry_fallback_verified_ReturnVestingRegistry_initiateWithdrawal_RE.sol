 *
 * === Detected Issues ===
 * 1. reentrancy-no-eth (SWC-107)
 *
 * === Description ===
 * A stateful, multi-transaction reentrancy vulnerability that requires two function calls separated by a time delay. The vulnerability exists in completeWithdrawal() where an external token transfer is made before updating the state variables. An attacker can exploit this by calling completeWithdrawal() multiple times through a malicious contract callback, draining funds while the pendingWithdrawals mapping still shows a positive balance.
