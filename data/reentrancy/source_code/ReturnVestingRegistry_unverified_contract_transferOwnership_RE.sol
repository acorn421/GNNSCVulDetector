 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a stateful, multi-transaction reentrancy vulnerability by adding an external call to the newOwner address before updating the owner state. This creates a window where a malicious new owner can re-enter the contract while still having the original owner's permissions active. The vulnerability requires multiple transactions: first to initiate the ownership transfer, then subsequent calls during the callback to exploit the inconsistent state where the old owner is still active but the new owner can manipulate the contract through reentrancy.
