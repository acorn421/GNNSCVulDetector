 * === Verification Results ===
 * Detected      : False
 * Relevant      : 0 findings
 * Total Found   : 3 issues
 * Retry Count   : 0
 *
 * === Description ===
 * Injected a stateful, multi-transaction reentrancy vulnerability by:
 * 
 * 1. **Added persistent state tracking**: Introduced `pendingWithdrawals` mapping and `totalPendingWithdrawals` to track withdrawal state across transactions
 * 
 * 2. **Violated Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern**: State updates occur both before AND after the external call, creating a window for reentrancy exploitation
 * 
 * 3. **Multi-transaction exploitation mechanism**: 
 *    - **Transaction 1**: Owner calls withdraw(), state is updated (pending withdrawal recorded), external call triggers reentrancy
 *    - **During reentrancy**: Attacker can observe inflated `totalPendingWithdrawals` state and exploit the inconsistency
 *    - **Transaction 2**: If original call fails and throws, state remains inconsistent, allowing manipulation in subsequent transactions
 *    - **Transaction 3+**: Multiple withdrawals can be queued up, creating accumulated state that can be exploited
 * 
 * 4. **State accumulation requirement**: The vulnerability requires building up state over multiple transactions - single transaction exploitation is not possible because the state inconsistency needs to persist and be leveraged across multiple calls
 * 
 * 5. **Realistic vulnerability pattern**: This mirrors real-world reentrancy patterns where state tracking systems create windows for exploitation during external calls
 * 
 * The vulnerability is only exploitable through multiple transactions because:
 * - State must accumulate in pendingWithdrawals across calls
 * - Reentrancy exploitation requires the inconsistent state to persist beyond a single transaction
 * - The attacker needs multiple opportunities to observe and manipulate the accumulated state
 * - Single transaction cannot fully exploit the state tracking mechanism
