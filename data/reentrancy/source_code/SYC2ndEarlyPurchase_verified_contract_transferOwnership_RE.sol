 * === Detected Issues ===
 * 1. reentrancy-no-eth (SWC-107)
 * 2. reentrancy-benign (SWC-107)
 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a stateful, multi-transaction reentrancy vulnerability by:
 * 
 * 1. **Added Persistent State**: Created `ownershipTransferPending` mapping to track pending ownership transfers across transactions
 * 2. **External Call Before State Update**: Added `newOwner.call()` before the critical `owner = newOwner` assignment, violating the checks-effects-interactions pattern
 * 3. **Vulnerable State Window**: The pending state persists between transactions when the external call fails, creating opportunities for exploitation
 * 
 * **Multi-Transaction Exploitation Scenario:**
 * 
 * **Transaction 1 (Setup):**
 * - Current owner calls `transferOwnership(maliciousContract)`
 * - `ownershipTransferPending[maliciousContract] = true` is set
 * - External call to `maliciousContract.onOwnershipTransferred()` is made
 * - Malicious contract can reenter and call other `onlyOwner` functions while `owner` is still the original owner
 * - If the external call fails or malicious contract makes it fail, ownership doesn't transfer but pending state remains
 * 
 * **Transaction 2+ (Exploitation):**
 * - The `ownershipTransferPending` state persists, indicating a failed transfer
 * - Malicious contract can monitor this state and exploit the fact that other functions might check `ownershipTransferPending` for additional privileges
 * - In subsequent transactions, the malicious contract can trigger the external call again, creating more reentrancy opportunities
 * - Each failed attempt leaves the contract in an inconsistent state where pending transfer exists but ownership hasn't changed
 * 
 * **Why Multi-Transaction is Required:**
 * - The vulnerability requires persistent state (`ownershipTransferPending`) to accumulate across transactions
 * - The exploit depends on the external call failing in one transaction, leaving vulnerable state for future transactions
 * - Reentrancy attacks during the external call can access the original owner's privileges while the transfer is pending
 * - Multiple attempts can be made to exploit the vulnerable state window, with each attempt potentially causing different state changes
