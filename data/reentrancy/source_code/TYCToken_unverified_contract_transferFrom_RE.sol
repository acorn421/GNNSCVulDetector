 *
 * === Description ===
 * This modification introduces a stateful, multi-transaction reentrancy vulnerability by adding an external call to the recipient contract (_to) before updating the allowance state. The vulnerability works as follows:
 * 
 * **Changes Made:**
 * 1. Added a conditional external call to the recipient contract using `_to.call()` with `onTokenReceived` signature
 * 2. The call is made BEFORE the allowance is decremented, creating a reentrancy window
 * 3. Added a check for contract code existence to make the call realistic
 * 4. The external call is made with transfer details, enabling the recipient to act on this information
 * 
 * **Multi-Transaction Exploitation:**
 * 1. **Transaction 1**: Attacker deploys a malicious contract that implements `onTokenReceived`
 * 2. **Transaction 2**: Token holder approves the attacker's contract for a certain amount
 * 3. **Transaction 3**: Attacker calls `transferFrom` with their malicious contract as `_to`
 * 4. **During Transaction 3**: The malicious contract's `onTokenReceived` is called before allowance is decremented
 * 5. **Reentrancy Attack**: The malicious contract can now call `transferFrom` again with the same allowance value
 * 6. **State Accumulation**: Each reentrant call exploits the same allowance value across multiple nested calls
 * 
 * **Why Multi-Transaction is Required:**
 * - The allowance must be set in a previous transaction through `approve()`
 * - The attacker needs to deploy their malicious contract beforehand
 * - The exploitation requires the contract to be called as the recipient, which requires setup
 * - The state (allowance mapping) persists between transactions and can be exploited multiple times
 * - The vulnerability builds upon the persistent allowance state that was established in earlier transactions
 * 
 * **Realistic Nature:**
 * - Token notifications to recipient contracts are common in modern ERC-20 implementations
 * - The code appears to be a legitimate attempt to notify recipients about incoming transfers
 * - The vulnerability is subtle and could easily be missed in code reviews
 * - The pattern follows real-world token implementations that include recipient callbacks
