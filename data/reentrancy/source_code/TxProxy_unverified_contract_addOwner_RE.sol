 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a stateful, multi-transaction reentrancy vulnerability by adding an external call to the new owner before state updates. The vulnerability requires multiple transactions to exploit:
 * 
 * **Changes Made:**
 * 1. Added external call to `_newOwner` using low-level call before pushing to owner array
 * 2. External call invokes `onOwnerAdded(address)` function on the new owner contract
 * 3. State update (owner.push) occurs after the external call, violating CEI pattern
 * 
 * **Multi-Transaction Exploitation:**
 * 1. **Transaction 1**: Attacker deploys malicious contract implementing `onOwnerAdded(address)`
 * 2. **Transaction 2**: Call `addOwner` with malicious contract address
 * 3. **During callback**: Malicious contract reenters `addOwner` to add additional malicious owners
 * 4. **State accumulation**: Each reentrant call adds more malicious owners to the array
 * 5. **Persistent impact**: Malicious owners remain in state across transactions
 * 
 * **Why Multi-Transaction is Required:**
 * - The `ownerNotAdded` modifier prevents adding the same owner twice in a single transaction
 * - Attacker needs separate transactions to add different malicious owner addresses
 * - State changes from previous transactions enable bypassing of access controls in subsequent calls
 * - The vulnerability creates persistent state corruption that compounds over multiple transactions
 * 
 * **Realistic Context:**
 * - Owner notification is a common pattern in governance contracts
 * - The external call appears legitimate for notifying new owners
 * - The vulnerability is subtle and could easily be missed in code review
