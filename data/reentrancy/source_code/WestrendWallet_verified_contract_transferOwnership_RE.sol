 * Status        : Verified

 *
 * === Verification Results ===
 * Detected      : True
 * Relevant      : 3 findings
 * Total Found   : 4 issues
 * Retry Count   : 0
 *
 * === Detected Issues ===
 * 1. reentrancy-no-eth (SWC-107)
 * 2. reentrancy-benign (SWC-107)
 * 3. reentrancy-events (SWC-107)
 *
 * === Description ===
 * This modification introduces a stateful, multi-transaction reentrancy vulnerability by:
 * 
 * 1. **Added Persistent State**: Introduced `pendingOwnershipTransfers` mapping to track ownership transfer status across transactions
 * 2. **External Call Before State Updates**: Added a call to `newOwner.call()` before finalizing the ownership transfer
 * 3. **State Vulnerability Window**: The `owner` variable is updated after the external call, creating a window where the contract state is inconsistent
 * 
 * **Multi-Transaction Exploitation Path:**
 * 
 * **Transaction 1 (Initial Setup):**
 * - Attacker deploys a malicious contract and gets whitelisted
 * - Attacker accumulates enough state/permissions in the contract system
 * 
 * **Transaction 2 (Ownership Transfer Trigger):**
 * - Current owner calls `transferOwnership(maliciousContract)`
 * - `pendingOwnershipTransfers[maliciousContract] = true` 
 * - External call to `maliciousContract.onOwnershipTransfer()` occurs
 * - During this callback, the malicious contract can:
 *   - Call back into the original contract while `owner` is still the old owner
 *   - Exploit functions that depend on `owner` state before it's updated
 *   - Potentially call `transferOwnership` again if the old owner is still set
 * 
 * **Transaction 3+ (State Exploitation):**
 * - The malicious contract can exploit the inconsistent state where:
 *   - `pendingOwnershipTransfers[maliciousContract] = true` (marked as pending)
 *   - But `owner` may still be the old owner during reentrancy
 *   - Other contract functions may behave unexpectedly due to this state inconsistency
 * 
 * **Why Multi-Transaction Dependency is Critical:**
 * - The vulnerability requires prior state setup (whitelisting, permissions)
 * - The `pendingOwnershipTransfers` state persists between transactions
 * - The exploit window exists only during the external call sequence
 * - The attacker needs multiple transactions to fully exploit the state inconsistency and potentially chain additional ownership transfers or privilege escalations
 * 
 * The vulnerability is realistic because ownership transfer notifications are common in production contracts, and the state management pattern could easily be introduced during contract upgrades or feature additions.
