 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a stateful, multi-transaction reentrancy vulnerability by adding an external call to the recipient contract BEFORE updating the allowance. This creates a window where:
 * 
 * 1. **Transaction 1**: Initial transferFrom call updates balances but makes external call before updating allowance
 * 2. **External Call Window**: Recipient contract can call transferFrom again in the same transaction or trigger additional transactions
 * 3. **State Inconsistency**: The allowance is not yet decremented, allowing repeated transfers using the same allowance across multiple transactions
 * 4. **Multi-Transaction Exploitation**: Attack requires coordination across multiple transactions to drain allowances and manipulate balances
 * 
 * The vulnerability is multi-transaction because:
 * - Initial transaction sets up the state (balances updated, allowance not yet decremented)
 * - External contract can initiate additional transferFrom calls in separate transactions
 * - Each subsequent transaction can exploit the stale allowance state
 * - The attack accumulates damage across multiple transaction boundaries
 * 
 * This pattern is realistic as token contracts often implement recipient notifications for compliance or integration purposes, but the improper ordering of state updates creates the vulnerability window.
