 * Relevant      : 0 findings
 * Total Found   : 0 issues
 * Retry Count   : 0
 *
 * === Description ===
 * This injection introduces a stateful, multi-transaction reentrancy vulnerability by adding a callback mechanism to contract recipients. The vulnerability leverages the fact that state changes (balance updates) persist between transactions, allowing an attacker to:
 * 
 * 1. **Setup Phase (Transaction 1)**: Deploy a malicious contract that implements onTokenReceived() to call transfer() again
 * 2. **Initial Transfer (Transaction 2)**: Call transfer() to the malicious contract, which triggers the callback
 * 3. **Reentrancy Chain (Multiple Transactions)**: The callback can initiate new transfer() calls, creating a chain of state-dependent reentrancy
 * 
 * The vulnerability is multi-transaction because:
 * - The malicious contract must be deployed first (separate transaction)
 * - Each reentrant call represents a new transaction in the call stack
 * - The attacker can accumulate multiple transfers by leveraging the persistent balance state changes
 * - The vulnerability requires setting up the attack infrastructure across multiple transactions
 * 
 * The key insight is that while individual balance updates are atomic, the overall attack requires multiple interrelated transactions where each callback creates new transaction contexts that can exploit the updated state from previous calls.
