 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a stateful, multi-transaction reentrancy vulnerability by adding an external call to the recipient (_to) address after balance updates but before allowance decreases. This creates a classic reentrancy vulnerability where:
 * 
 * 1. **Setup Phase (Transaction 1)**: Attacker must first call approve() to grant allowance to their malicious contract
 * 2. **Exploitation Phase (Transaction 2)**: Attacker calls transferFrom(), which triggers the external call to their malicious contract
 * 3. **Reentrant Call**: During the external call, the malicious contract can call transferFrom() again before the allowance is decreased
 * 4. **Double Spending**: The same allowance value is used twice, enabling the attacker to transfer more tokens than authorized
 * 
 * The vulnerability is stateful because:
 * - It requires persistent allowance state set up in a previous transaction
 * - Balance and allowance state changes accumulate across multiple calls
 * - The exploit window exists between balance updates and allowance decreases
 * 
 * The vulnerability is multi-transaction because:
 * - Requires initial approve() call to set up allowance
 * - Requires subsequent transferFrom() call to trigger the reentrancy
 * - Cannot be exploited in a single atomic transaction without prior state setup
 * 
 * This follows the checks-effects-interactions pattern violation, where external calls happen before all state updates are complete, creating a realistic and exploitable reentrancy vulnerability commonly found in production token contracts.
