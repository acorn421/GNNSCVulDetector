 * === Detected Issues ===
 * 1. reentrancy-no-eth (SWC-107)
 * 2. reentrancy-events (SWC-107)
 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a stateful, multi-transaction reentrancy vulnerability by adding an external call to the recipient contract before state updates. The vulnerability requires multiple transactions to exploit:
 * 
 * **Specific Changes Made:**
 * 1. Added external call to recipient contract using `_to.call()` with `onTokenReceived` callback
 * 2. The external call is placed AFTER the balance check but BEFORE the state updates
 * 3. This violates the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern by introducing an external interaction before effects
 * 
 * **Multi-Transaction Exploitation Scenario:**
 * 1. **Transaction 1**: Attacker deploys malicious contract that implements `onTokenReceived`
 * 2. **Transaction 2**: Attacker calls `transfer()` to send tokens to their malicious contract
 * 3. **During Transaction 2**: The malicious contract's `onTokenReceived` callback is triggered before balance updates
 * 4. **Reentrancy Window**: The callback can call `transfer()` again while sender's balance hasn't been decremented yet
 * 5. **Transaction 3+**: Multiple reentrant calls can be made, each seeing the original balance before any decrements
 * 
 * **Why Multi-Transaction is Required:**
 * - The attacker must first deploy and set up the malicious contract (Transaction 1)
 * - The initial transfer that triggers the callback is a separate transaction (Transaction 2)
 * - The reentrant calls within the callback create additional state-dependent execution paths
 * - The vulnerability depends on the persistent state of balances across multiple transaction contexts
 * - Each reentrant call can potentially drain more tokens than the attacker's actual balance
 * 
 * **State Persistence Factor:**
 * - The `balances` mapping state persists between transactions
 * - The malicious contract's state and logic persist on the blockchain
 * - Each transaction builds upon the previous state, enabling cumulative exploitation
 * 
 * This creates a realistic reentrancy vulnerability that requires careful orchestration across multiple transactions and depends on accumulated state changes.
