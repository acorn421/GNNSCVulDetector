 *
 * === Description ===
 * This vulnerability involves timestamp dependence where the contract relies on 'now' (block.timestamp) for time-based logic. The vulnerability is stateful and multi-transaction: 1) First transaction calls scheduleWithdrawal() which sets a future timestamp based on 'now + withdrawalDelay', 2) Second transaction calls executeWithdrawal() which checks if 'now >= scheduledTime'. Miners can manipulate block timestamps within certain bounds (Â±15 seconds typically), allowing them to either delay or accelerate withdrawal executions. The state persists between transactions through the withdrawalRequests mapping, making this a multi-transaction vulnerability that requires accumulated state changes.
