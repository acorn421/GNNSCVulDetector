/*
 * ===== SmartInject Injection Details =====
 * Function      : scheduleMaintenanceWindow
 * Vulnerability : Timestamp Dependence
 * Status        : Not Detected
 * Type          : Fallback Function Addition
 *
 * === Verification Results ===
 * Detected      : False
 * Relevant      : 0 findings
 * Total Found   : 8 issues
 * Retry Count   : 0
 *
 * === Description ===
 * This introduces a multi-transaction timestamp dependence vulnerability where: 1) An attacker first schedules a maintenance window for a future time, 2) The attacker (if they control mining or can manipulate timestamps) can then activate the maintenance window by manipulating the block timestamp to fall within the scheduled window, 3) Finally, they can perform emergency maintenance actions that bypass normal token withdrawal validations. The vulnerability requires multiple transactions and state persistence between calls, making it stateful and exploitable over time.
