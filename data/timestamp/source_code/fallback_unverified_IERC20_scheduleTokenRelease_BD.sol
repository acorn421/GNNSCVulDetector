 * === Description ===
 * This function introduces a timestamp dependence vulnerability in a multi-transaction scenario. The owner can schedule token releases for specific times, but the vulnerability lies in the reliance on block.timestamp for time-based logic. A malicious miner could manipulate block timestamps to either delay or accelerate scheduled releases. The vulnerability requires multiple transactions: first to schedule the release, then to claim it, making it stateful and requiring persistence between transactions.
