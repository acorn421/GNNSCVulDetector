 * Function      : scheduleOwnershipTransfer
 * Vulnerability : Timestamp Dependence
 * Status        : Not Detected
 * Type          : Fallback Function Addition

 * === Verification Results ===
 * Detected      : False
 * Relevant      : 0 findings
 * Total Found   : 2 issues
 * Retry Count   : 0
 *
 * === Description ===
 * This vulnerability involves timestamp dependence where the ownership transfer can be manipulated by miners. The vulnerability is stateful and requires multiple transactions: (1) scheduleOwnershipTransfer to set the pending owner and timestamp, (2) executeOwnershipTransfer after the delay period. A malicious miner can manipulate block timestamps to either delay or accelerate the ownership transfer, potentially allowing unauthorized access or preventing legitimate transfers. The state persists between transactions through pending_owner and ownership_transfer_timestamp variables.

/* The Burner v1.0, Main-Net release.
*  ~by Gluedog 
*  -----------
*
*  Compiler version: 0.4.19+commit.c4cbbb05.Emscripten.clang
*
* The Burner is Billionaire Token's version of a "Faucet" - an evil, twisted Faucet. 
* Just like a Faucet, people can use it to get some extra coins. 
* Unlike a Faucet, the Burner will also burn coins and reduce the maximum supply in the process of giving people extra coins.
* The Burner is only usable by addresses who have also participated in the last week's Raffle round.
