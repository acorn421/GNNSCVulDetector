 * === Description ===
 * This vulnerability introduces timestamp dependence where the contract relies on 'now' (block.timestamp) for time-based withdrawal restrictions. A malicious miner can manipulate block timestamps within reasonable bounds (Â±15 seconds) to potentially bypass the 1-day waiting period. The vulnerability requires multiple transactions: first calling enableTimedWithdrawals(), then requestWithdrawal(), and finally executeWithdrawal() after the timestamp check. The state persists between these calls through the mapping variables, making it a stateful multi-transaction vulnerability.
