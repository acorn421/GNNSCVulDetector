 * === Description ===
 * This function introduces a timestamp dependence vulnerability where the extension count reset logic depends on block timestamp comparisons. An attacker can exploit this by manipulating transaction timing within the same block to bypass extension limits. The vulnerability is stateful (tracks extensionCount and lastExtensionTime) and requires multiple transactions to exploit - first to set up the state, then to exploit the timestamp comparison weakness.
