 * Detected      : False
 * Relevant      : 0 findings

 *
 * === Description ===
 * This vulnerability introduces timestamp dependence in a multi-transaction emergency voting system. The vulnerability requires multiple transactions: (1) scheduling emergency voting, (2) casting votes during the time window, and (3) finalizing the voting. Miners can manipulate timestamps to either extend voting periods to gather more votes or cut them short to prevent opposition votes. The vulnerability is stateful as it maintains emergency voting state across multiple transactions and the exploitation requires specific timing and sequence of operations.
