 * === Description ===
 * This vulnerability introduces a timestamp dependence issue where the contract relies on 'now' (block.timestamp) for timing-critical operations. The vulnerability is stateful and multi-transaction: 1) Owner first calls scheduleJackpotIncrease() to set up a scheduled increase with a specific timestamp, 2) Any user can later call executeScheduledIncrease() once the timestamp condition is met. Miners can manipulate block timestamps within certain bounds (Â±15 seconds typically), allowing them to potentially trigger the scheduled increase earlier or delay it, affecting the contract's intended timing behavior. The state persists between transactions through the scheduledIncreaseTime, scheduledIncreaseAmount, and increaseScheduled variables.
