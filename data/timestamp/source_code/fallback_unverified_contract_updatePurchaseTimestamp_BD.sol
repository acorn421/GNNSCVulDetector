 * === Description ===
 * This function introduces a timestamp dependence vulnerability where users can manipulate purchase timestamps within a tolerance window. The vulnerability is stateful because it requires: 1) First making a purchase (creating state), 2) Then calling updatePurchaseTimestamp to modify the stored timestamp. This could allow users to game time-based bonuses or manipulate purchase ordering by setting timestamps to their advantage. The vulnerability persists across transactions as the modified timestamp remains in contract storage.
