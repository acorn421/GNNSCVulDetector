 * === Description ===
 * This injection introduces a timestamp dependence vulnerability in a multi-transaction withdrawal system. The vulnerability requires multiple transactions: 1) requestWithdrawal() to initiate the request, 2) waiting for the delay period, 3) withdrawTokens() to execute the withdrawal. The vulnerability relies on the 'now' timestamp which can be manipulated by miners within a 900-second window. An attacker who controls mining can manipulate the timestamp to either bypass the delay period or extend it, affecting the withdrawal timing and potentially causing financial losses or denial of service.
