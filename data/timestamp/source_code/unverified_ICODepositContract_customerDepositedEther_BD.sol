 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a stateful, multi-transaction timestamp dependence vulnerability that combines time-based bonus calculations with accumulated state tracking. The vulnerability requires multiple deposits across different time windows to exploit effectively.
 * 
 * **Specific Changes Made:**
 * 
 * 1. **Time-based Bonus Multiplier**: Added logic that doubles incentive payments during specific time windows (1 minute every 5 minutes) based on `block.timestamp % 300 < 60`
 * 
 * 2. **Milestone Timestamp Storage**: Introduced `lastMilestoneTime` state variable that gets updated when `totalDeposits` reaches multiples of 10 ether, creating persistent state between transactions
 * 
 * 3. **Progressive Fee Reduction**: Added fee reduction logic that activates only when accumulated deposits exceed 50 ether AND more than 1 hour has passed since the last milestone
 * 
 * **Multi-Transaction Exploitation Scenarios:**
 * 
 * 1. **Bonus Window Exploitation**: Attackers can monitor the timestamp patterns and make strategic deposits during the "lucky" 1-minute windows to double their incentive payments
 * 
 * 2. **Milestone Manipulation**: Attackers can time their deposits to:
 *    - Reach milestone thresholds (10 ether multiples) at strategic timestamps
 *    - Wait for the 1-hour delay to exploit fee reductions on subsequent deposits
 *    - Coordinate multiple smaller deposits to accumulate favorable timing conditions
 * 
 * 3. **Compound Exploitation**: The most profitable attack requires:
 *    - Transaction 1: Deposit during bonus window to set favorable milestone timestamp
 *    - Transaction 2: Wait 1+ hours, then deposit â‰¥50 ether total to trigger fee reduction
 *    - Transaction 3: Make additional deposits combining bonus timing + fee reduction
 * 
 * **Why Multiple Transactions Are Required:**
 * 
 * - **State Accumulation**: The `totalDeposits` variable must accumulate across multiple calls to reach the 50 ether threshold
 * - **Time Persistence**: The `lastMilestoneTime` must be set in one transaction and used in subsequent transactions after the 1-hour delay
 * - **Timing Coordination**: Optimal exploitation requires coordinating deposits across multiple time windows and waiting periods
 * - **Compound Benefits**: Maximum profit requires combining bonus multipliers with fee reductions across sequential transactions
 * 
 * This creates a realistic ICO scenario where timing-based bonuses and progressive fee structures are common, but the reliance on manipulable block timestamps creates exploitable vulnerabilities.
