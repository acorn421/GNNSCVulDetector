 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a stateful, multi-transaction timestamp dependence vulnerability in the ownership transfer mechanism. The vulnerability requires two separate transactions and introduces multiple timestamp-dependent weaknesses:
 * 
 * 1. **Multi-Transaction Requirement**: The function now requires two separate transactions - first to initiate the transfer with timestamp-based delay, second to complete it after the time lock expires.
 * 
 * 2. **State Persistence**: Added state variables (pendingOwner, transferInitiatedAt, transferUnlocksAt) that persist between transactions, making the vulnerability stateful.
 * 
 * 3. **Timestamp Manipulation Vulnerabilities**:
 *    - Variable delay calculation based on block.timestamp modulo creates predictable patterns
 *    - Random security check using block.timestamp and block.difficulty can be manipulated by miners
 *    - Time-based validation can be bypassed through timestamp manipulation
 * 
 * 4. **Exploitation Scenarios**:
 *    - Miners can manipulate block timestamps (Â±900 seconds) across multiple blocks
 *    - First transaction sets predictable delay, second transaction can be timed when random check is favorable
 *    - Attackers can calculate optimal timing windows for the random security check
 *    - The random check failure forces retry, creating opportunities for timestamp manipulation
 * 
 * 5. **Realistic Implementation**: The code appears to implement "enhanced security" with time delays and random checks, but actually introduces vulnerabilities that require multiple transactions to exploit effectively.
