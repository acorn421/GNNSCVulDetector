 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a timestamp-dependent daily withdrawal limit system that tracks withdrawal amounts and reset times using block.timestamp. The vulnerability creates a multi-transaction exploit where attackers can manipulate miners to adjust block timestamps, allowing them to bypass daily withdrawal limits by triggering premature resets of their withdrawal counters.
 * 
 * **Specific Changes Made:**
 * 1. **State Variables Added**: Added three new state variables to track withdrawal patterns:
 *    - `lastWithdrawTime`: Maps each address to their last withdrawal timestamp
 *    - `dailyWithdrawn`: Maps each address to their total withdrawals in current 24-hour period
 *    - `maxDailyWithdraw`: Sets the maximum daily withdrawal limit (10 ether)
 * 
 * 2. **Timestamp-Based Logic**: Added time-based calculations using `block.timestamp` to determine when the 24-hour period resets, making the contract vulnerable to timestamp manipulation.
 * 
 * 3. **State Persistence**: The vulnerability requires state changes that persist between transactions, specifically the tracking of withdrawal amounts and timestamps.
 * 
 * **Multi-Transaction Exploitation Scenario:**
 * 1. **Transaction 1**: Attacker makes maximum daily withdrawal (10 ether), setting `lastWithdrawTime[attacker] = block.timestamp` and `dailyWithdrawn[attacker] = 10 ether`
 * 
 * 2. **Between Transactions**: Attacker coordinates with miners or waits for favorable conditions to manipulate `block.timestamp` in subsequent blocks
 * 
 * 3. **Transaction 2**: Attacker calls `Divest()` again in a block where miners have set `block.timestamp` to be `lastWithdrawTime[attacker] + 24 hours` or greater, even though less than 24 hours have actually passed
 * 
 * 4. **Exploitation Result**: The condition `block.timestamp >= lastWithdrawTime[msg.sender] + 24 hours` evaluates to true, resetting `dailyWithdrawn[attacker] = 0` and allowing another 10 ether withdrawal
 * 
 * **Why Multi-Transaction is Required:**
 * - **State Accumulation**: The vulnerability requires previous withdrawal state to be established in earlier transactions
 * - **Time-Based Dependency**: The exploit depends on the relationship between stored timestamps from previous transactions and current block timestamps
 * - **Sequential Exploitation**: Cannot be exploited in a single transaction because it requires the passage of time (or manipulation of time) between withdrawal attempts
 * - **Miner Coordination**: Requires coordination across multiple blocks/transactions to manipulate timestamps effectively
 * 
 * **Realistic Vulnerability Pattern:**
 * This mirrors real-world vulnerabilities where contracts use `block.timestamp` for time-sensitive operations without considering that miners can manipulate timestamps within reasonable bounds (Â±900 seconds), and sophisticated attackers might coordinate with miners for more significant manipulations.
