 * Status        : Not Detected

 *
 * === Verification Results ===
 * Detected      : False
 * Relevant      : 0 findings
 * Total Found   : 1 issues
 * Retry Count   : 0
 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a stateful, multi-transaction timestamp dependence vulnerability that requires:
 * 
 * 1. **State Variables Added** (assume these exist in contract):
 *    - `uint256 public ownershipTransferWindow` - stores the timestamp window for valid transfers
 *    - `address public pendingOwner` - stores the pending new owner address
 *    - `uint256 public lastOwnershipUpdate` - tracks last ownership-related action
 * 
 * 2. **Multi-Transaction Attack Sequence**:
 *    - **Transaction 1**: Initial call sets up the transfer window based on `block.timestamp % 300` (5-minute intervals)
 *    - **Transaction 2+**: Subsequent calls must occur during specific 5-minute windows when `block.timestamp % 300` matches the stored window
 * 
 * 3. **Timestamp Manipulation Vectors**:
 *    - Attackers can predict/manipulate when valid transfer windows occur
 *    - Miners can adjust block timestamps within Â±15 seconds to hit favorable windows
 *    - The modulo operation creates predictable patterns that can be exploited
 *    - Multiple transactions across different blocks are required to exploit timing windows
 * 
 * 4. **Exploitation Requirements**:
 *    - Requires at least 2 transactions (setup + execution)
 *    - State persists between transactions via storage variables
 *    - Timing dependencies span multiple blocks
 *    - Cannot be exploited in a single atomic transaction due to time window requirements
 * 
 * This creates a realistic vulnerability where ownership transfers are restricted to specific time windows that can be predicted and potentially manipulated by sophisticated attackers coordinating across multiple transactions.
