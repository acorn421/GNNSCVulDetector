 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a timestamp dependence vulnerability by adding time-based validation using block.timestamp modulo operation. The password can only be closed during specific time windows (when block.timestamp % 256 < 128), creating a vulnerability where miners can manipulate block timestamps to either prevent legitimate closure or enable unauthorized access. This requires multiple transactions across different time periods to exploit:
 * 
 * **Exploitation Scenario:**
 * 1. **Transaction 1**: SetPass() - User sets password hash, establishing the initial state
 * 2. **Transaction 2**: PassHasBeenSet() - User attempts to close password during "invalid" time window (block.timestamp % 256 >= 128) and fails
 * 3. **Transaction 3**: PassHasBeenSet() - User waits/retries during "valid" time window (block.timestamp % 256 < 128) and succeeds
 * 
 * **Multi-Transaction Exploitation:**
 * - **State Dependency**: The vulnerability depends on the persistent state established by SetPass() (hashPass and sender variables)
 * - **Temporal Dependency**: The exploitation requires timing across multiple blocks/transactions
 * - **Miner Manipulation**: Miners can manipulate block timestamps within the allowed drift (~15 seconds) to influence whether the condition passes
 * - **Accumulated State**: The vulnerability combines persistent contract state (password hash) with temporal state (block timestamp)
 * 
 * **Why Multiple Transactions Required:**
 * - The password must first be set in a separate transaction (SetPass)
 * - Users must attempt closure at specific time windows
 * - The timing dependency cannot be controlled within a single transaction
 * - Miners can influence the outcome by manipulating timestamps between transactions
 * 
 * This creates a realistic vulnerability pattern where temporal logic introduces unpredictable behavior that can be exploited across multiple transactions.
