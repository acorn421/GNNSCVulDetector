 * Status        : Not Detected

 *
 * === Description ===
 * This modification introduces a stateful, multi-transaction Timestamp Dependence vulnerability through the following changes:
 * 
 * **1. Timestamp Storage**: Added `gameCreationTime[msg.value] = block.timestamp;` during game creation to store the creation timestamp in persistent state.
 * 
 * **2. Time-based Bonus System**: Implemented a bonus calculation system that rewards faster gameplay based on `block.timestamp - gameTimestamp`. This creates incentives for timestamp manipulation.
 * 
 * **3. Timestamp-based Game Outcome Manipulation**: Added logic that modifies the game outcome when `block.timestamp % 100 < 10`, giving creators an advantage during specific timestamp ranges.
 * 
 * **Multi-Transaction Exploitation**:
 * - **Transaction 1**: Create game - stores `block.timestamp` in state
 * - **Transaction 2**: Play game - uses stored timestamp and current `block.timestamp` for bonus calculation and outcome manipulation
 * 
 * **Exploitation Method**:
 * 1. Miners can manipulate `block.timestamp` during game creation to store favorable timestamps
 * 2. When playing, miners can adjust `block.timestamp` to:
 *    - Maximize bonuses (appear to play within 5-15 minutes)
 *    - Trigger the outcome manipulation condition (`timestamp % 100 < 10`)
 *    - Influence the existing `rand()` function which also uses `block.timestamp`
 * 
 * **Why Multi-Transaction Required**:
 * - The vulnerability requires the timestamp to be stored in state during game creation
 * - The exploitation occurs when comparing stored timestamp with current timestamp during gameplay
 * - Single transaction cannot exploit both the storage and comparison phases
 * - State persistence between transactions enables the timestamp manipulation attack
 * 
 * This creates a realistic vulnerability where miners can manipulate block timestamps across multiple transactions to gain unfair advantages in game outcomes and bonus calculations.
