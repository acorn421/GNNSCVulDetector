 * ===== SmartInject Injection Details =====
 * Function      : SetupToken
 * Vulnerability : Timestamp Dependence
 * Status        : Not Detected
 * Type          : Function Modification
 *
 * === Verification Results ===
 * Detected      : False
 * Relevant      : 0 findings
 * Total Found   : 3 issues
 * Retry Count   : 0
 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a multi-transaction timestamp dependence vulnerability by:
 * 
 * 1. **State Variables Added**: Added setupStartTime, setupWindowDuration, and setupInitiated to track the setup process state across multiple transactions.
 * 
 * 2. **Two-Phase Setup Process**: Modified the function to require two separate transactions:
 *    - First transaction: Sets setupStartTime = block.timestamp and setupInitiated = true
 *    - Second transaction: Must occur within the time window to complete setup
 * 
 * 3. **Time-Dependent Token Supply**: The final token supply is calculated based on the elapsed time between setup initiation and completion, creating a direct timestamp dependence.
 * 
 * **Multi-Transaction Exploitation:**
 * - **Transaction 1**: Owner calls SetupToken() to initiate setup window, stores block.timestamp
 * - **Transaction 2**: Owner calls SetupToken() again within the time window to complete setup
 * - **Vulnerability**: Miners can manipulate block.timestamp in the second transaction to:
 *   - Maximize the time bonus multiplier (making timeElapsed larger)
 *   - Potentially cause setup to fail by making block.timestamp exceed the window
 *   - Control the exact token supply through timestamp manipulation
 * 
 * **Why Multi-Transaction is Required:**
 * - The vulnerability cannot be exploited in a single transaction because the setup process requires state persistence between calls
 * - The setupStartTime must be stored in the first transaction and referenced in the second
 * - The time window validation and bonus calculation depend on the time difference between two separate blocks
 * - Miners cannot manipulate timestamps within a single transaction, but can influence them across multiple blocks
 * 
 * This creates a realistic scenario where the token's total supply can be manipulated through timestamp attacks across multiple transactions, requiring miners to coordinate timestamp manipulation across consecutive blocks.
