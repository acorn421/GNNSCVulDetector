 * ===== SmartInject Injection Details =====
 * Function      : addVideoGameItem
 * Vulnerability : Timestamp Dependence
 * Status        : Not Detected

 * === Verification Results ===
 * Detected      : False
 * Relevant      : 0 findings

 * Retry Count   : 0
 *
 * === Description ===
 * Injected a stateful, multi-transaction Timestamp Dependence vulnerability by making item pricing and creation dependent on block.timestamp and block.number values. The vulnerability requires multiple transactions to exploit:
 * 
 * 1. **Timestamp-dependent pricing**: Uses block.timestamp % 100 as a multiplier, creating price variations based on when items are created
 * 2. **Peak hour discounts**: Items created during specific timestamp ranges (first half of each hour) receive 50% discounts
 * 3. **Block number randomness**: Uses block.number % 10 to influence item properties, creating deterministic but exploitable patterns
 * 
 * **Multi-Transaction Exploitation Process:**
 * 1. **Transaction 1**: Attacker analyzes current block.timestamp and block.number to identify optimal timing
 * 2. **Transaction 2**: Attacker waits for favorable timestamp conditions (e.g., during peak hour discount window)
 * 3. **Transaction 3**: Attacker executes addVideoGameItem during the optimal timestamp window to get discounted prices
 * 4. **Transaction 4+**: Attacker can repeat the process, timing multiple item creations to maximize benefits
 * 
 * **Why Multiple Transactions Are Required:**
 * - The vulnerability depends on block timestamp progression, which only occurs between blocks/transactions
 * - Attackers must wait for favorable timestamp windows to exploit the discount mechanism
 * - The exploitation requires timing coordination across multiple blocks to maximize the benefit
 * - Each transaction occurs in a different block with different timestamps, enabling the time-based manipulation
 * 
 * **State Persistence:**
 * - The timestamp-dependent pricing affects the permanent state of items stored in the videoGameItems array
 * - Once items are created with manipulated prices, they remain permanently affected in the contract state
 * - Future interactions with these items will be based on the timestamp-manipulated values
 * 
 * This creates a realistic vulnerability where miners or sophisticated attackers can manipulate transaction timing to exploit price discounts and create items with favorable properties.
