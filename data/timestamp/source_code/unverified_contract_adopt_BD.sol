 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a stateful, multi-transaction Timestamp Dependence vulnerability through time-based JackPot contribution calculations. The vulnerability involves:
 * 
 * 1. **Timestamp-Based Bonus System**: Uses block.timestamp % 300 == 0 to determine when to double contributions, creating predictable timing windows that miners can manipulate.
 * 
 * 2. **Stored Timestamp Logic**: Stores block.timestamp in a local variable and uses it for multiple calculations, allowing for timing-dependent state changes.
 * 
 * 3. **Accumulated State Exploitation**: The vulnerability depends on ticketCounter state that accumulates across transactions, combined with timestamp calculations that create exploitable timing windows.
 * 
 * 4. **Multi-Transaction Exploitation Path**:
 *    - **Transaction 1**: Attacker calls adopt() to increment ticketCounter and establish timing baseline
 *    - **Wait Period**: Attacker waits for favorable timestamp conditions (when block.timestamp % 300 == 0 or other timing conditions align)
 *    - **Transaction 2**: Attacker calls adopt() again when timing conditions are met to receive massive JackPot bonuses
 * 
 * 5. **Miner Manipulation Potential**: Miners can manipulate block timestamps within reasonable bounds (Â±15 seconds) to:
 *    - Ensure block.timestamp % 300 == 0 for double contributions
 *    - Align timing calculations for the complex bonus condition
 *    - Exploit the predictable timing windows for maximum JackPot contribution
 * 
 * The vulnerability is realistic because timestamp-based bonuses are common in lottery systems, but the predictable nature and miner manipulation potential create a serious security flaw that requires multiple transactions and accumulated state to exploit effectively.
