 * === Description ===
 * Injected a stateful, multi-transaction timestamp dependence vulnerability through a time-based discount system. The vulnerability allows miners to manipulate block.timestamp across multiple transactions to accumulate discounts and purchase items at significantly reduced prices. The system tracks user purchase history and applies increasing discounts for purchases within a 5-minute window, creating a state-dependent exploit that requires multiple coordinated transactions to maximize benefit.

/*  In the event that the frontend goes down you will still be able to access the contract
    through myetherwallet.  You go to myetherwallet, select the contract tab, then copy paste in the address
    of the farming contract.  Then copy paste in the ABI and click access.  You will see the available functions 
    in the drop down below.

    Quick instructions for each function. List of addresses for token and shops found here.  http://ethercraft.info/index.php/Addresses 

    farmItem:  shop_address is the address of the item shop you want to farm.  buy_amount is the amount you want to buy.
    e.g. stone boots.  shop_address = 0xc5cE28De7675a3a4518F2F697249F1c90856d0F5, buy_amount = 100

    withdrawMultiTokens: takes in multiple token_addresses that you want to withdraw.  Token addresses can be found in the site above.
    e.g. token_address1, token_address2, token_address3.

    If you want to view the balance of a token you have in the contract select tokenInventory in the dropdown on myetherwallet.
    The first address box is the address you used to call the farm function from.
    The second address box is the address of the token you want to check.
    The result is the amount you have in the contract.*/
