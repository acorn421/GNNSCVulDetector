 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a timestamp dependence vulnerability that creates a stateful, multi-transaction exploit opportunity. The vulnerability involves:
 * 
 * 1. **Time-based Price Manipulation**: The function now calculates an adjusted price using block.timestamp divided by 86400 (24 hours), creating a predictable price increase pattern that attackers can exploit by timing their transactions.
 * 
 * 2. **State Persistence**: Added lastBuybackTime[reciever] = block.timestamp to store user-specific timestamp data, creating persistent state that enables multi-transaction exploitation patterns.
 * 
 * **Multi-Transaction Exploitation Scenario:**
 * - **Transaction 1**: Attacker calls buyback() just before a 24-hour boundary (e.g., when block.timestamp / 86400 is about to increment)
 * - **Transaction 2**: Attacker waits for the timestamp boundary to cross, then calls buyback() again to receive the higher price multiplier
 * - **State Accumulation**: The stored lastBuybackTime creates opportunities for more complex timing attacks across multiple users and transactions
 * 
 * **Why Multi-Transaction is Required:**
 * - The vulnerability requires waiting for block.timestamp to change significantly (24-hour increments) to maximize profit
 * - Single transaction cannot exploit the time-based price differences
 * - The stateful lastBuybackTime storage enables complex exploitation patterns that require multiple function calls
 * - Attackers need to accumulate state across multiple transactions to identify optimal timing windows
 * 
 * **Realistic Attack Vector:**
 * - Miners can manipulate block.timestamp within consensus limits (Â±15 seconds) to slightly adjust timing
 * - Attackers can monitor pending transactions and time their buybacks to exploit price boundaries
 * - Multiple coordinated accounts can exploit the time-based pricing across different boundary periods
