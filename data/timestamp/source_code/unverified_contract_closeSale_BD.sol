/*
 * ===== SmartInject Injection Details =====
 * Function      : closeSale
 * Vulnerability : Timestamp Dependence
 * Status        : Not Detected
 * Type          : Function Modification
 *
 * === Verification Results ===
 * Detected      : False
 * Relevant      : 0 findings
 * Total Found   : 2 issues
 * Retry Count   : 0
 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a stateful, multi-transaction timestamp dependence vulnerability by:
 * 
 * 1. **Added State Variable Dependency**: The function now relies on a `pendingCloseTimestamp` state variable that must be set in a previous transaction before the sale can actually be closed.
 * 
 * 2. **Multi-Transaction Requirement**: 
 *    - First transaction: Sets `pendingCloseTimestamp = block.timestamp` and returns false
 *    - Second transaction: Must wait at least 60 seconds AND occur during a specific time window (first half of every 256-second cycle)
 * 
 * 3. **Timestamp Manipulation Vulnerability**: The function uses `block.timestamp % 256 < 128` to create predictable time windows. Miners can manipulate block timestamps within the ~15-second tolerance to:
 *    - Prevent legitimate close attempts by ensuring timestamps fall in the second half of the cycle
 *    - Enable their own transactions by manipulating timestamps to fall in the first half
 *    - Control the exact timing of when sales can be closed
 * 
 * 4. **Exploitation Scenario**:
 *    - Transaction 1: Director calls closeSale() â†’ sets pendingCloseTimestamp, returns false
 *    - Miner manipulation: Manipulate subsequent block timestamps to prevent legitimate closes
 *    - Transaction 2: Attacker or miner calls closeSale() during manipulated favorable time window
 *    - Result: Control over when the sale can be closed, potentially affecting crowdsale economics
 * 
 * 5. **State Persistence**: The `pendingCloseTimestamp` state persists between transactions, creating a stateful vulnerability that requires multiple calls to exploit.
 * 
 * This vulnerability is realistic because it mimics real-world patterns where developers add time-based restrictions for security or business logic, but inadvertently create timestamp manipulation attack vectors.
