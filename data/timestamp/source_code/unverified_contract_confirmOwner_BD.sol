 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a stateful, multi-transaction timestamp dependence vulnerability by implementing a time-based confirmation delay system. The vulnerability requires two separate transactions: first to record the confirmation timestamp, and second to complete the ownership transfer after the delay period. The critical flaw is the reliance on block.timestamp for security-critical timing logic, which can be manipulated by miners within a 900-second window according to Ethereum consensus rules.
 * 
 * **Specific Changes Made:**
 * 1. **Added State Variables**: 
 *    - `ownershipConfirmationTime` mapping to track when each address first attempted confirmation
 *    - `CONFIRMATION_DELAY` constant defining the required waiting period
 * 
 * 2. **Multi-Transaction Logic**:
 *    - First call: Records `block.timestamp` and returns early
 *    - Second call: Checks if enough time has passed using timestamp arithmetic
 *    - State persists between transactions in the mapping
 * 
 * **Multi-Transaction Exploitation Scenario:**
 * 1. **Transaction 1**: Legitimate new owner calls `confirmOwner()` â†’ timestamp recorded
 * 2. **Transaction 2**: Attacker (who is a miner or collaborates with miners) manipulates `block.timestamp` to be earlier than expected, allowing them to complete ownership transfer before the intended delay
 * 3. **Alternative**: Miner can manipulate timestamps to extend or reduce the delay window for their benefit
 * 
 * **Why Multi-Transaction is Required:**
 * - The vulnerability cannot be exploited in a single transaction because the state (confirmation timestamp) must be set in one transaction and checked in another
 * - The time-based logic depends on the progression of block timestamps between transactions
 * - The exploit requires the ability to influence block timestamps across multiple blocks, which is only possible through sequential transactions
 * 
 * **Realistic Vulnerability Pattern:**
 * This mirrors real-world timelock implementations that incorrectly rely on block.timestamp for critical security delays, making it a realistic vulnerability that could appear in production code.
