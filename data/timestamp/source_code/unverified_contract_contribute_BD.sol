 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a timestamp dependence vulnerability through an early bird bonus system. The function now uses block.timestamp to determine if contributions are made within the first hour after pool creation, granting a 10% bonus to early contributors. This creates a multi-transaction vulnerability where:
 * 
 * 1. **State Accumulation**: The first contributor sets the timestamp baseline (pool.buy_block = block.timestamp), establishing the bonus period window
 * 2. **Multi-Transaction Exploitation**: Subsequent contributors can exploit timestamp manipulation across multiple transactions to gain unfair bonuses
 * 3. **Miner Manipulation**: Miners can manipulate block timestamps within the 900-second tolerance to extend or manipulate the bonus period
 * 4. **Sequential Attack**: An attacker can make multiple contributions across different blocks, manipulating timestamps to always fall within the bonus period
 * 
 * The vulnerability requires multiple transactions because:
 * - Transaction 1: Sets the initial timestamp baseline
 * - Transaction 2+: Exploits timestamp manipulation to gain bonuses unfairly
 * - The bonus calculation depends on accumulated state from previous transactions
 * - Single-transaction exploitation is impossible as you need the baseline timestamp to be set first
