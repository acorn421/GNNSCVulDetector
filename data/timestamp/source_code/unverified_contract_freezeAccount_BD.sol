 * Function      : freezeAccount
 * Vulnerability : Timestamp Dependence
 * Status        : Not Detected
 * Type          : Function Modification
 *
 * === Verification Results ===
 * Detected      : False
 * Relevant      : 0 findings
 * Total Found   : 1 issues
 * Retry Count   : 0
 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a stateful, multi-transaction timestamp dependence vulnerability through a two-phase freeze mechanism. The vulnerability requires multiple transactions to exploit and involves storing timestamps in state variables for time-based validation. 
 * 
 * **Specific Changes Made:**
 * 1. **Added State Variables**: `freezeTimestamps` and `tempFreezeRequests` mappings to track timing data
 * 2. **Two-Phase Freeze Logic**: Freezing now requires two separate transactions within 24 hours
 * 3. **Timestamp-Based Validation**: Uses `block.timestamp` for critical timing decisions
 * 4. **Minimum Duration Enforcement**: Prevents unfreezing until minimum time has passed
 * 
 * **Multi-Transaction Exploitation:**
 * The vulnerability can be exploited through timestamp manipulation across multiple transactions:
 * 
 * **Transaction 1 (Setup)**: Owner calls `freezeAccount(target, true)` - creates temporary freeze request with current `block.timestamp`
 * **Transaction 2 (Exploit)**: Within 24 hours, owner calls `freezeAccount(target, true)` again - activates permanent freeze
 * 
 * **Exploitation Vectors:**
 * 1. **Miner Timestamp Manipulation**: Miners can manipulate `block.timestamp` between transactions to bypass or extend time windows
 * 2. **Temporal Race Conditions**: Attackers can exploit timing dependencies by controlling when transactions are mined
 * 3. **State Persistence Attack**: The stored timestamps in state variables can be manipulated over time through multiple transactions
 * 
 * **Why Multi-Transaction Required:**
 * - The vulnerability requires at least 2 separate transactions to activate the freeze mechanism
 * - State changes from Transaction 1 (storing `tempFreezeRequests[target]`) enable the vulnerability in Transaction 2
 * - The exploit cannot be performed atomically in a single transaction as it depends on time passage verification
 * - The stored timestamp state persists between transactions, creating a window for manipulation
 * 
 * **Realistic Vulnerability Pattern:**
 * This mirrors real-world patterns where administrative actions require multi-step confirmation processes with time-based validation, making it a realistic vulnerability that could appear in production code.
