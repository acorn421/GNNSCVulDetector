 * ===== SmartInject Injection Details =====
 * Function      : initLottery
 * Vulnerability : Timestamp Dependence
 * Status        : Not Detected
 * Type          : Function Modification

 * === Verification Results ===
 * Detected      : False
 * Relevant      : 0 findings
 * Total Found   : 1 issues
 * Retry Count   : 0
 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a stateful, multi-transaction Timestamp Dependence vulnerability by:
 * 
 * 1. **State Storage**: Added a mapping `lotteryInitTimestamp` that stores the block.timestamp for each lottery initialization, creating persistent state that subsequent transactions can depend on.
 * 
 * 2. **Timestamp-Based Logic**: The function now uses `block.timestamp % 2` to determine lottery parameter modifications, making the lottery initialization dependent on miner-manipulable block timestamps.
 * 
 * 3. **Duration Adjustment**: The lottery duration is modified based on `block.timestamp % 100`, meaning miners can influence lottery parameters by manipulating the timestamp.
 * 
 * **Multi-Transaction Exploitation Path:**
 * 
 * **Transaction 1 (Setup)**: 
 * - Malicious miner calls `initLottery()` and manipulates `block.timestamp` to be even
 * - This triggers the adjusted duration calculation, potentially extending the lottery window
 * - The manipulated timestamp is stored in `lotteryInitTimestamp[lotteryCounter]`
 * 
 * **Transaction 2+ (Exploitation)**:
 * - The stored timestamp from Transaction 1 affects the lottery's entire lifecycle
 * - Other functions in the lottery contract (like ticket purchasing, winner selection) can reference `lotteryInitTimestamp` 
 * - Subsequent lottery operations depend on the initially manipulated timestamp
 * - The adjusted duration gives the miner advantage in timing-dependent operations
 * 
 * **Why Multi-Transaction is Required:**
 * 1. **State Persistence**: The timestamp manipulation in initLottery() affects the entire lottery lifecycle through stored state
 * 2. **Sequence Dependency**: The vulnerability requires the initial setup (storing manipulated timestamp) followed by exploitation in subsequent lottery operations
 * 3. **Cross-Function Impact**: The stored timestamp can be referenced by other lottery functions, creating a chain of dependencies across multiple transactions
 * 4. **Time-Window Exploitation**: The adjusted duration creates timing advantages that only manifest over multiple transactions as the lottery progresses
 * 
 * This creates a realistic vulnerability where miners can manipulate lottery initialization to gain advantages in subsequent lottery operations.
