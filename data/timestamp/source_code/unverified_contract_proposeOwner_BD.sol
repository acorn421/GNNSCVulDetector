 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a timestamp dependence vulnerability by adding time-based security mechanisms that use block.timestamp for critical access control logic. The vulnerability manifests through:
 * 
 * 1. **Specific Changes Made:**
 *    - Added `require(block.timestamp >= lastProposalTime + proposalCooldown, "Proposal cooldown active")` to enforce a cooldown period between ownership proposals
 *    - Set `proposalTimestamp = block.timestamp` to record when the proposal was made
 *    - Set `lastProposalTime = block.timestamp` to track the last proposal time for cooldown enforcement
 * 
 * 2. **Multi-Transaction Exploitation:**
 *    The vulnerability requires multiple transactions to exploit:
 *    
 *    **Transaction 1 (Setup):** 
 *    - Current owner calls `proposeOwner()` to set a new proposed owner
 *    - `lastProposalTime` is set to current `block.timestamp`
 *    - State is now primed for exploitation
 *    
 *    **Transaction 2 (Exploitation):**
 *    - Attacker (who must be a miner or coordinate with miners) manipulates `block.timestamp`
 *    - If they want to bypass the cooldown: They mine blocks with timestamps that jump forward, making `block.timestamp >= lastProposalTime + proposalCooldown` true prematurely
 *    - If they want to block proposals: They mine blocks with timestamps that don't advance sufficiently, keeping the cooldown active longer than intended
 *    - Multiple subsequent calls to `proposeOwner()` can now be manipulated based on the timestamp manipulation
 * 
 * 3. **Why Multiple Transactions Are Required:**
 *    - **State Accumulation:** The vulnerability relies on the persistent state variables `lastProposalTime` and `proposalTimestamp` that are set in one transaction and checked in subsequent transactions
 *    - **Sequential Dependency:** The cooldown mechanism only becomes exploitable after an initial proposal has been made, requiring at least two separate transactions
 *    - **Time-Based Logic:** The timestamp manipulation attack requires the attacker to control block timestamps across multiple blocks/transactions, which is impossible to do atomically
 *    - **Realistic Attack Vector:** Miners can manipulate timestamps by up to 900 seconds (15 minutes) according to Ethereum protocol rules, but this manipulation is only effective across multiple blocks, not within a single transaction
 * 
 * **Attack Scenarios:**
 * - **Scenario A:** A malicious miner or miner-coordinated attacker can make rapid ownership changes by mining blocks with accelerated timestamps to bypass cooldown periods
 * - **Scenario B:** An attacker can prevent legitimate ownership changes by manipulating timestamps to extend cooldown periods indefinitely
 * - **Scenario C:** In a contested ownership situation, timestamp manipulation can give unfair advantages in timing-sensitive ownership transfers
 * 
 * This creates a realistic, stateful vulnerability where the timestamp dependence affects the ownership proposal process across multiple transactions, requiring accumulated state changes and sequential operations to exploit effectively.
