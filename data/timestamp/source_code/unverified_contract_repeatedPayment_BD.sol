 * ===== SmartInject Injection Details =====
 * Function      : repeatedPayment
 * Vulnerability : Timestamp Dependence
 * Status        : Not Detected
 * Type          : Function Modification
 *
 * === Verification Results ===
 * Detected      : False
 * Relevant      : 0 findings
 * Total Found   : 10 issues
 * Retry Count   : 0
 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a stateful, multi-transaction timestamp dependence vulnerability where:
 * 
 * 1. **Time-based Commission Discounts**: The function applies discounts based on block.timestamp % 86400 for "off-peak" hours, making commissions dependent on manipulable timestamps.
 * 
 * 2. **Persistent State Storage**: Added `clientDeposit.lastUpdateTimestamp = block.timestamp` to store when payment parameters were last updated, creating state that persists across transactions.
 * 
 * 3. **Multi-Transaction Exploitation**: The vulnerability requires multiple transactions to exploit:
 *    - **Transaction 1**: Owner calls `repeatedPayment` for the first time, setting `lastUpdateTimestamp`
 *    - **Transaction 2+**: Subsequent calls to `repeatedPayment` compare current `block.timestamp` with stored `lastUpdateTimestamp` to apply "loyalty" discounts for frequent updates within 1 hour
 * 
 * 4. **Timestamp Manipulation Vectors**:
 *    - Miners can manipulate `block.timestamp` to:
 *      - Ensure the transaction falls within "off-peak" hours (00:00-08:00 UTC) for base discounts
 *      - Manipulate the time difference calculation to appear as if updates happen within 1 hour for additional discounts
 *      - Combine both manipulations for maximum discount (20% + 10% = 28% total commission reduction)
 * 
 * 5. **Real-world Exploitation**: 
 *    - An attacker (owner or miner) can coordinate to manipulate timestamps across multiple transactions
 *    - Each subsequent call builds on the state from previous transactions
 *    - The vulnerability accumulates benefits across multiple calls, making it stateful and multi-transaction dependent
 * 
 * The vulnerability preserves the function's core logic while creating realistic timestamp-dependent behavior that could appear in production code attempting to implement time-based pricing or loyalty discounts.
