 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a stateful, multi-transaction timestamp dependence vulnerability in the replaceOwner function. The vulnerability requires multiple transactions and involves:
 * 
 * 1. **State Variables Added**: 
 *    - `ownershipCooldown`: Global cooldown period between ownership changes
 *    - `lastOwnerChange`: Timestamp of the last successful owner change
 *    - `ownershipRequests`: Mapping to track pending ownership requests with their timestamps
 * 
 * 2. **Multi-Transaction Exploitation Path**:
 *    - **Transaction 1**: First call to replaceOwner creates a pending request stored in `ownershipRequests` mapping
 *    - **Transaction 2**: Second call (after waiting period) processes the pending request and changes ownership
 *    - The vulnerability relies on `block.timestamp` for time validation, which miners can manipulate within ~15 seconds
 * 
 * 3. **Timestamp Dependence Vulnerabilities**:
 *    - **Miner Manipulation**: Miners can adjust `block.timestamp` within the 15-second tolerance to bypass time locks
 *    - **Predictable Timing**: Attackers can predict exact block timestamps and time their transactions accordingly
 *    - **Race Conditions**: Multiple pending requests can be exploited by timing transactions around block boundaries
 * 
 * 4. **Stateful Nature**:
 *    - The `ownershipRequests` mapping persists between transactions
 *    - `lastOwnerChange` tracks historical state across multiple calls
 *    - The vulnerability requires accumulating state through multiple function invocations
 * 
 * 5. **Multi-Transaction Requirement**:
 *    - Single transaction cannot exploit the vulnerability due to the mandatory waiting period
 *    - Requires at least 2 separate transactions in different blocks
 *    - State changes from first transaction enable exploitation in subsequent transactions
 * 
 * 6. **Realistic Exploitation Scenario**:
 *    - Attacker calls replaceOwner() to create a pending request
 *    - Attacker waits for favorable block conditions or colludes with miners
 *    - Attacker calls replaceOwner() again with manipulated block.timestamp to bypass the time lock
 *    - The timestamp validation can be bypassed through miner manipulation or precise timing attacks
