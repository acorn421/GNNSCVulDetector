 * ===== SmartInject Injection Details =====
 * Function      : setCurrentToken
 * Vulnerability : Timestamp Dependence
 * Status        : Not Detected
 * Type          : Function Modification
 *
 * === Verification Results ===
 * Detected      : False
 * Relevant      : 0 findings
 * Total Found   : 7 issues
 * Retry Count   : 0
 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a stateful, multi-transaction Timestamp Dependence vulnerability by:
 * 
 * 1. **Added time-based access control**: Token changes are only allowed during specific 1-hour windows every 12 hours using `block.timestamp % 43200 < 3600`. This creates a timing dependency that miners can manipulate.
 * 
 * 2. **Timestamp-dependent balance calculation**: The `dappBalance` calculation depends on `block.timestamp % 86400` to determine whether to use the current token balance or keep the previous cached balance. This allows miners to manipulate when balance updates occur.
 * 
 * 3. **State persistence**: Added `lastTokenChangeTime` state variable that stores the timestamp, enabling multi-transaction exploitation patterns where attackers can monitor and exploit timing windows across multiple blocks.
 * 
 * **Multi-Transaction Exploitation Scenario:**
 * - **Transaction 1**: Attacker monitors for pending `setCurrentToken` calls and identifies timing windows
 * - **Transaction 2**: Miner manipulates `block.timestamp` to either bypass the time restriction or manipulate the balance calculation
 * - **Transaction 3**: Subsequent contract operations (like `claimGasDrop`) use the manipulated `dappBalance`, allowing exploitation
 * 
 * **Why Multi-Transaction:**
 * - The vulnerability requires monitoring timing windows across multiple blocks
 * - Miners need to coordinate timestamp manipulation with pending transactions
 * - The cached balance state persists between transactions, enabling exploitation in future calls
 * - The time-based restrictions create windows that must be exploited across multiple block intervals
 * 
 * This creates a realistic timestamp dependence vulnerability that requires state accumulation and sequential exploitation across multiple transactions, making it impossible to exploit atomically in a single transaction.
