 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a stateful, multi-transaction timestamp dependence vulnerability by implementing a two-phase ownership transfer mechanism with a time delay. The vulnerability relies on block.timestamp for enforcing a mandatory waiting period between initiating and completing the ownership transfer.
 * 
 * **Specific Changes Made:**
 * 
 * 1. **Added State Variables:**
 *    - `ownershipTransferInitiatedAt`: Stores block.timestamp when transfer is initiated
 *    - `pendingOwner`: Stores the address of the pending new owner
 *    - `ownershipTransferInProgress`: Boolean flag tracking transfer state
 *    - `OWNERSHIP_TRANSFER_DELAY`: 3-day constant delay period
 * 
 * 2. **Modified Function Logic:**
 *    - **First Transaction**: Initiates transfer by setting timestamp and pending owner
 *    - **Second Transaction**: Completes transfer after validating timestamp delay
 *    - Uses `block.timestamp` for time-based validation (vulnerable to miner manipulation)
 * 
 * **Multi-Transaction Exploitation Scenario:**
 * 
 * 1. **Transaction 1 (Initiation):**
 *    - Current owner calls `transferOwnershipWithBalance(maliciousAddress)`
 *    - Sets `ownershipTransferInitiatedAt = block.timestamp`
 *    - Sets `pendingOwner = maliciousAddress`
 *    - Sets `ownershipTransferInProgress = true`
 * 
 * 2. **Waiting Period:**
 *    - System expects 3-day delay before completion
 *    - Vulnerable to miner timestamp manipulation during this period
 * 
 * 3. **Transaction 2 (Completion):**
 *    - Same or different actor calls `transferOwnershipWithBalance(maliciousAddress)`
 *    - Validates `block.timestamp >= ownershipTransferInitiatedAt + OWNERSHIP_TRANSFER_DELAY`
 *    - Transfers ownership and all tokens to new owner
 * 
 * **Timestamp Manipulation Vulnerabilities:**
 * 
 * 1. **Miner Timestamp Manipulation:**
 *    - Miners can manipulate block.timestamp within ~900 seconds
 *    - Could potentially reduce the effective delay period
 *    - Multiple miners could coordinate to accelerate the timeline
 * 
 * 2. **Block.timestamp Dependency:**
 *    - Using block.timestamp for critical security delays is vulnerable
 *    - Timestamp can be manipulated by miners within consensus rules
 *    - No protection against systematic timestamp manipulation
 * 
 * **Why Multi-Transaction Nature is Required:**
 * 
 * 1. **State Persistence**: The vulnerability requires persistent state between transactions (`ownershipTransferInitiatedAt`, `pendingOwner`, `ownershipTransferInProgress`)
 * 
 * 2. **Time-Based Validation**: The delay mechanism inherently requires waiting between transactions, making single-transaction exploitation impossible
 * 
 * 3. **Stateful Progression**: The function behavior changes based on previous transaction state, requiring multiple calls to complete the exploit
 * 
 * 4. **Accumulative Effect**: The vulnerability emerges from the combination of stored timestamp data and subsequent validation, not from any single transaction
 * 
 * This creates a realistic vulnerability where an attacker could potentially exploit timestamp manipulation across multiple transactions to bypass intended security delays in ownership transfers.
