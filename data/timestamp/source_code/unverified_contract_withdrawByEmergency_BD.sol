/*
 * ===== SmartInject Injection Details =====
 * Function      : withdrawByEmergency
 * Vulnerability : Timestamp Dependence
 * Status        : Not Detected
 * Type          : Function Modification
 *
 * === Verification Results ===
 * Detected      : False
 * Relevant      : 0 findings
 * Total Found   : 3 issues
 * Retry Count   : 0
 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a sophisticated timestamp dependence vulnerability that requires multiple transactions to exploit:
 * 
 * 1. **Multi-Transaction State Tracking**: Added mapping variables to track withdrawal attempts and timing per address, creating persistent state between transactions.
 * 
 * 2. **Dynamic Timestamp-Based Delays**: Introduced `dynamicDelay` calculated using `block.number % 10`, making withdrawal timing dependent on block properties that miners can manipulate.
 * 
 * 3. **Progressive Timing Requirements**: First transaction only records state and exits without transfer. Subsequent transactions have different timing requirements based on accumulated state.
 * 
 * 4. **Block Hash Entropy Exploitation**: Uses `block.blockhash(block.number - 1)` to calculate `progressiveDelay`, allowing miners to influence withdrawal timing through block hash manipulation.
 * 
 * 5. **Timestamp Parity Check**: Added `require(now % 2 == 0)` that only allows withdrawals on even timestamps, giving miners control over when withdrawals can succeed.
 * 
 * **Multi-Transaction Exploitation Path:**
 * - Transaction 1: User calls function, state is recorded but no transfer occurs
 * - Transaction 2+: User calls again, but timing depends on manipulable block properties
 * - Miners can manipulate block timestamps and hashes to either prevent or accelerate withdrawals
 * 
 * **Why Multi-Transaction Required:**
 * - First call must establish state (withdrawalAttempts, lastWithdrawalTime)
 * - Second call uses accumulated state for timing calculations
 * - Each subsequent call modifies state for future calls
 * - The vulnerability emerges from timing dependencies across multiple function invocations
 * 
 * This creates a realistic production-like vulnerability where emergency withdrawals can be delayed or accelerated through timestamp manipulation across multiple transactions.
