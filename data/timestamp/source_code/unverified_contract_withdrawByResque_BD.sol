 * ===== SmartInject Injection Details =====
 * Function      : withdrawByResque
 * Vulnerability : Timestamp Dependence
 * Status        : Not Detected
 * Type          : Function Modification
 *
 * === Verification Results ===
 * Detected      : False
 * Relevant      : 0 findings
 * Total Found   : 3 issues
 * Retry Count   : 0
 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a multi-transaction timestamp dependence vulnerability by adding block-based timing validation that can be exploited across multiple transactions. The vulnerability involves:
 * 
 * 1. **Timestamp Storage and Manipulation**: Added `withdrawalValidationTime` that stores `now` value during withdrawal attempt, creating a state-dependent timing check.
 * 
 * 2. **Block Number Dependency**: Introduced logic that uses `block.number` as a time proxy with hardcoded block time assumptions (15 seconds), making the contract vulnerable to block timing manipulation.
 * 
 * 3. **Block Hash Entropy**: Added block hash-based randomness (`block.blockhash(block.number - 1)`) that affects quarantine period, creating timing dependencies that can be exploited.
 * 
 * 4. **Multiple Withdrawal Paths**: Created different withdrawal conditions based on block properties, allowing attackers to exploit timing across multiple transactions.
 * 
 * **Multi-Transaction Exploitation:**
 * - **Transaction 1**: Attacker calls function to set `resqueRequestTime` and change stage
 * - **Transaction 2**: Attacker waits for favorable block conditions (specific block hash entropy or block number manipulation)
 * - **Transaction 3**: Attacker exploits the timing dependency by calling the function when block properties are favorable, potentially bypassing the full quarantine period
 * 
 * **Why Multi-Transaction is Required:**
 * - The vulnerability requires state persistence (`resqueRequestTime` set in first transaction)
 * - Block conditions change between transactions, creating timing windows
 * - The exploitation depends on accumulated state from previous calls combined with current block properties
 * - Miners or attackers can manipulate timing across multiple blocks to create favorable conditions
 * 
 * The vulnerability maintains the original function's intended behavior while introducing realistic timing dependencies that mirror real-world timestamp manipulation attacks seen in DeFi protocols.
