 *
 * === Description ===
 * Introduced a stateful timestamp dependence vulnerability through a dynamic withdrawal limit system that relies on block.timestamp. The vulnerability requires multiple transactions to exploit and involves several state variables that track withdrawal timing and limits:
 * 
 * 1. **State Variables Required** (to be added to contract):
 *    - `mapping(address => uint) public lastWithdrawalDay` - Tracks last withdrawal day per user
 *    - `mapping(address => uint) public dailyWithdrawalAmount` - Tracks daily withdrawal amounts
 *    - `mapping(address => uint) public lastWithdrawalTime` - Tracks last withdrawal timestamp
 *    - `uint public baseWithdrawalLimit = 1000e6` - Base daily limit (1000 USDT)
 *    - `uint public limitIncreaseRate = 100` - Rate of limit increase per second
 * 
 * 2. **Multi-Transaction Exploitation**:
 *    - **Transaction 1**: User makes initial withdrawal, setting lastWithdrawalTime
 *    - **Transaction 2+**: User waits for time passage or exploits timestamp manipulation to increase dynamicLimit
 *    - **Exploitation**: Miners can manipulate block.timestamp to artificially increase timeSinceLastWithdrawal, allowing users to exceed intended daily limits
 * 
 * 3. **Vulnerability Mechanics**:
 *    - Dynamic limit calculation uses block.timestamp difference to increase withdrawal limits
 *    - Miners controlling block.timestamp can manipulate time calculations
 *    - Daily reset logic based on block.timestamp / 86400 can be exploited at day boundaries
 *    - Users can collude with miners to set favorable timestamps for higher limits
 * 
 * 4. **Stateful Nature**:
 *    - Requires persistent state tracking across multiple transactions
 *    - Each withdrawal updates state variables that affect future withdrawals
 *    - Exploitation requires sequence of transactions with strategic timing
 *    - Cannot be exploited in single transaction - requires time-based state accumulation
